Nature,2025-Jun-18,Kupffer cell programming by maternal obesity triggers fatty liver disease.,"Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis<sup>1</sup>. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions<sup>1-3</sup>. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism<sup>4</sup>. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases<sup>5</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09190-w
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Morphodynamics of human early brain organoid development.,"Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development<sup>4</sup>. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09151-3
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Gut inflammation promotes microbiota-specific CD4 T cell-mediated neuroinflammation.,"The microbiota has been recognized as a critical contributor to various diseases<sup>1</sup>, with multiple reports of changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in contexts such as inflammatory bowel disease<sup>2,3</sup> and neurodegenerative diseases<sup>4</sup>. These microbial shifts can exert systemic effects by altering the release of specific metabolites into the bloodstream<sup>5,6</sup>, and the gastrointestinal microbiota has also been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory activity through the activation of innate and adaptive immunity<sup>7,8</sup>. However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (T<sub>comm</sub> cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated T<sub>comm</sub> cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of T<sub>comm</sub> cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09120-w
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Unsupervised pretraining in biological neural networks.,"Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction. In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity<sup>1-13</sup>, but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09180-y
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Allosteric modulation and biased signalling at free fatty acid receptor 2.,"Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is a primary sensor for short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota. Consequently, FFA2 is a promising drug target for immunometabolic disorders<sup>1-4</sup>. Here we report cryogenic electronic microscopy structures of FFA2 in complex with two G proteins and three distinct classes of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), and describe noncanonical activation mechanisms that involve conserved structural features of class A GPCRs. Two PAMs disrupt the E/DRY activation microswitch<sup>5</sup> and stabilize the conformation of intracellular loop 2 by binding to lipid-facing pockets near the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. By contrast, the third PAM promotes the separation of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 by interacting with transmembrane helix 6 at the receptor-lipid interface. Molecular dynamic simulations and mutagenesis experiments confirm these noncanonical activation mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular basis for the G<sub>i</sub> versus G<sub>q</sub> bias, which is due to distinct conformations of intracellular loop 2 stabilized by different PAMs. These findings provide a framework for the design of tailored GPCR modulators, with implications that extend beyond FFA2 to the broader field of GPCR drug discovery.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09186-6
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Major expansion in the human niche preceded out of Africa dispersal.,"All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka)<sup>1-9</sup>. By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa<sup>10-15</sup>. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09154-0
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Targeting de novo purine biosynthesis for tuberculosis treatment.,"Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor targeting PurF, the first enzyme in the mycobacterial de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The lead candidate, JNJ-6640, exhibited nanomolar bactericidal activity in vitro. Comprehensive genetic and biochemical approaches confirmed that JNJ-6640 was highly selective for mycobacterial PurF. Single-cell-level microscopy demonstrated a downstream effect on DNA replication. We determined the physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleobases in human and mouse lung tissue, showing that these levels were insufficient to salvage PurF inhibition. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using a long-acting injectable formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the compound. Finally, we show that inclusion of JNJ-6640 could have a crucial role in improving current treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Together, we demonstrate that JNJ-6640 is a promising chemical lead and that targeting de novo purine biosynthesis represents a novel strategy for tuberculosis drug development.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09177-7
Nature,2025-Jun-18,R9AP is a common receptor for EBV infection in epithelial cells and B cells.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persistently infects more than 90% of the human population, causing infectious mononucleosis<sup>1</sup>, susceptibility to autoimmune diseases<sup>2</sup> and multiple malignancies of epithelial or B cell-origin<sup>3</sup>. EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells through interaction between viral glycoproteins and different host receptors<sup>4</sup>, but it has remained unknown whether a common receptor mediates infection of its two major host cell targets. Here, we establish R9AP as a crucial EBV receptor for entry into epithelial and B cells. R9AP silencing or knockout, R9AP-derived peptide and R9AP monoclonal antibody each significantly inhibit, whereas R9AP overexpression promotes, EBV uptake into both cell types. R9AP binds directly to the EBV glycoprotein gH/gL complex to initiate gH/gL-gB-mediated membrane fusion. Notably, the interaction of R9AP with gH/gL is inhibited by the highly competitive gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1, which blocks EBV epithelial and B cell entry. Moreover, R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with EBV gp42-human leukocyte antigen class II or gH/gL-EPHA2 complexes in B cells or epithelial cells, respectively. We propose R9AP as the crucial common receptor of B cells and epithelial cells and a potential prophylactic and vaccine target for EBV.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09166-w
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Bioinspired capillary force-driven super-adhesive filter.,"Capturing particles with low, nanonewton-scale adhesion is an ongoing challenge for conventional air filters<sup>1,2</sup>. Inspired by the natural filtration abilities of mucus-coated nasal hairs<sup>3,4</sup>, we introduce an efficient, biomimetic filter that exploits a thin liquid coating. Here we show that a stable thin liquid layer is formed on several filter media that generates enhanced particulate adhesion, driven by micronewton to sub-micronewton capillary forces<sup>5,6</sup>. Enhanced particle adhesion increases the filtration of airborne particulates while maintaining air permeability, providing longer filter lifetime and increased energy savings. Moreover, strong adhesion of the captured particles enables effective filtration under high-speed airflow as well as suppression of particle redispersion. We anticipate that these filters with thin liquid layers afford a new way to innovate particulate matter filtering systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09156-y
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Optical nonlinearities in excess of 500 through sublattice reconstruction.,"The ability of materials to respond to stimuli with significant optical nonlinearity is crucial for technological advancement and innovation<sup>1-3</sup>. Although photon-avalanche upconversion nanomaterials with nonlinearities exceeding 60 have been developed, further enhancement remains challenging<sup>4-6</sup>. Here we present a method to increase photon-avalanche nonlinearity beyond 500 by reconstructing the sublattice and extending the avalanche network. We demonstrate that lutetium substitution in the host material induces significant local crystal field distortions. These distortions strengthen cross-relaxation, the key process governing population accumulation. As a result, the optical nonlinearity is significantly amplified, enabling sub-diffraction imaging through single-beam scanning microscopy, achieving lateral and axial resolutions of 33 nm (about 1/32 of λ<sub>Exc</sub>) and 80 nm (around 1/13 of λ<sub>Exc</sub>), respectively (where λ<sub>Exc</sub> is the excitation wavelength). Moreover, our research shows regional differentiation within photon-avalanche nanocrystals, in which photon-avalanche performance varies across different regions at the single-nanoparticle level. This effect, coupled with extreme optical nonlinearity, enables visualization of nanoemitters at resolutions beyond their physical size using simple instrumentation. These advancements open new possibilities for super-resolution imaging, ultra-sensitive sensing, on-chip optical switching and infrared quantum counting.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09164-y
Nature,2025-Jun-18,In vivo mapping of mutagenesis sensitivity of human enhancers.,"Distant-acting enhancers are central to human development<sup>1</sup>. However, our limited understanding of their functional sequence features prevents the interpretation of enhancer mutations in disease<sup>2</sup>. Here we determined the functional sensitivity to mutagenesis of human developmental enhancers in vivo. Focusing on seven enhancers that are active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1,700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-base-pair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modelling, we annotated critical nucleotides at the base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes in in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks. Taken together, our results reveal that human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function and provide a rich resource for further exploration of human enhancer logic.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09182-w
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Machine-learning design of ductile FeNiCoAlTa alloys with high strength.,"The pursuit of strong yet ductile alloys has been ongoing for centuries. However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature. The few that do are mostly ultra-strong steels<sup>1-3</sup>; however, their stress-strain curves exhibit plateaus and serrations because their tensile flow suffers from plastic instability (such as Lüders strains)<sup>1-4</sup>, and the elongation is pseudo-uniform at best. Here we report that a group of carefully engineered multi-principal-element alloys, with a composition of Fe<sub>35</sub>Ni<sub>29</sub>Co<sub>21</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>Ta<sub>3</sub> designed by means of domain knowledge-informed machine learning, can be processed to reach an unprecedented range of simultaneously high strength and ductility. An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L1<sub>2</sub> nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09160-2
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Bimodal centromeres in pentaploid dogroses shed light on their unique meiosis.,"Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes<sup>1</sup>. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents<sup>2,3</sup>. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09171-z
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Complete computational design of high-efficiency Kemp elimination enzymes.,"Until now, computationally designed enzymes exhibited low catalytic rates<sup>1-5</sup> and required intensive experimental optimization to reach activity levels observed in comparable natural enzymes<sup>5-9</sup>. These results exposed limitations in design methodology and suggested critical gaps in our understanding of the fundamentals of biocatalysis<sup>10,11</sup>. We present a fully computational workflow for designing efficient enzymes in TIM-barrel folds using backbone fragments from natural proteins and without requiring optimization by mutant-library screening. Three Kemp eliminase designs exhibit efficiencies greater than 2,000 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The most efficient shows more than 140 mutations from any natural protein, including a novel active site. It exhibits high stability (greater than 85 °C) and remarkable catalytic efficiency (12,700 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and rate (2.8 s<sup>-1</sup>), surpassing previous computational designs by two orders of magnitude<sup>1-5</sup>. Furthermore, designing a residue considered essential in all previous Kemp eliminase designs increases efficiency to more than 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and rate to 30 s<sup>-1</sup>, achieving catalytic parameters comparable to natural enzymes and challenging fundamental biocatalytic assumptions. By overcoming limitations in design methodology<sup>11</sup>, our strategy enables programming stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature enzymes through a minimal experimental effort.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09136-2
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin dynamics of the human brain in PTSD.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure. Recent studies have begun to detail the molecular biology of PTSD. However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identified so far<sup>1</sup>, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profile the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specific manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinflammation. We further validated these findings using cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics, confirming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specific context. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting effects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09083-y
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Bogong moths use a stellar compass for long-distance navigation at night.,"Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited-a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer<sup>1,2</sup>. At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator<sup>3-5</sup>, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth's known magnetic sense<sup>4</sup>), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth's brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth's magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09135-3
Nature,2025-Jun-18,Strategies for climate-resilient global wind and solar power systems.,"Climate change may amplify the frequency and severity of supply-demand mismatches in future power systems with high shares of wind and solar energy<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with such climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods-defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (i.e., the most-costly 10% of hours)-are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly due to the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the SSP126 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. Promisingly, the risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply-demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility. Our findings provide critical insights for building future climate-resilient power systems while reducing system costs.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09266-7
Nature,2025-Jun-16,Cryo-EM structure of a natural RNA nanocage.,"Long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse aspects of life. Over 20 classes of lncRNAs have been identified in bacteria and bacteriophages through comparative genomics analyses, but their biological functions remain largely unexplored<sup>1-3</sup>. Due to the large sizes, the structural determinants of most lncRNAs also remain uncharacterized. Here we report the structures of two natural RNA nanocages formed by the lncRNA ROOL (rumen-originating, ornate, large) found in bacterial and phage genomes. ~2.9 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal that ROOL RNAs form an octameric nanocage with a 28-nm diameter and 20-nm axial length, whose hollow inside features poorly ordered regions. The octamer is stabilized by numerous tertiary and quaternary interactions, including triple-strand A-minors that we propose to name ""A-minor staples"". The structure of an isolated ROOL monomer at ~3.2-Å resolution indicates that nanocage assembly involves a strand-swapping mechanism resulting in quaternary kissing loops. Finally, we show that ROOL RNA fused to an RNA aptamer, tRNA, or microRNA retains its structure forming a nanocage with radially displayed cargos. Our findings therefore may enable the engineering of novel RNA nanocages as delivery vehicles for research and therapeutic applications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09262-x
Nature,2025-Jun-12,An instantaneous voice-synthesis neuroprosthesis.,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore communication for people who have lost the ability to speak owing to a neurological disease or injury. BCIs have been used to translate the neural correlates of attempted speech into text<sup>1-3</sup>. However, text communication fails to capture the nuances of human speech, such as prosody and immediately hearing one's own voice. Here we demonstrate a brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real time to change intonation and sing short melodies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enabling people with paralysis to speak intelligibly and expressively through a BCI.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09127-3
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Remote activation of place codes by gaze in a highly visual animal.,"Vision enables many animals to perform spatial reasoning from remote locations<sup>1</sup>. By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells<sup>2,3</sup>, the relationship between place cells and active visual behaviour is unknown. Here we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behaviour that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast ballistic head movements called 'head saccades'<sup>4,5</sup>. On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that is relevant to the animal in each moment. This process allows the hippocampus to implement both local and remote spatial functions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09101-z
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Metabolic adaptations direct cell fate during tissue regeneration.,"Although cell-fate specification is generally attributed to transcriptional regulation, emerging data also indicate a role for molecules linked with intermediary metabolism. For example, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which fuels energy production and biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is also a co-factor for chromatin-modifying enzymes<sup>1-3</sup>. Nevertheless, whether TCA-cycle metabolites regulate cell fate during tissue homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that TCA-cycle enzymes are expressed in the intestine in a heterogeneous manner, with components of the αKG dehydrogenase complex<sup>4-6</sup> upregulated in the absorptive lineage and downregulated in the secretory lineage. Using genetically modified mouse models and organoids, we reveal that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), the enzymatic subunit of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, has a dual, lineage-specific role. In the absorptive lineage, OGDH is upregulated by HNF4 transcription factors to maintain the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of enterocytes. In the secretory lineage, OGDH is downregulated through a process that, when modelled, increases the levels of αKG and stimulates the differentiation of secretory cells. Consistent with this, in mouse models of colitis with impaired differentiation and maturation of secretory cells, inhibition of OGDH or supplementation with αKG reversed these impairments and promoted tissue healing. Hence, OGDH dependency is lineage-specific, and its regulation helps to direct cell fate, offering insights for targeted therapies in regenerative medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09097-6
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Brain implantation of soft bioelectronics via embryonic development.,"Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate<sup>1,2</sup>. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development<sup>3-9</sup>. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue's natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development. In axolotl models, it not only records neural electrical activity during regeneration but also modulates the process through electrical stimulation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09106-8
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Molecular hydrogen in the extremely metal- and dust-poor galaxy Leo P.,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early Universe, in tension with galaxy-formation models<sup>1-3</sup>. At the low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust typical in early galaxies, the formation of molecular hydrogen and its connection to star formation remain poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in predominantly atomic gas at low metallicity<sup>4,5</sup>, in contrast to molecular gas at higher metallicities<sup>6</sup>. Despite repeated searches<sup>7</sup>, cold molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% solar metallicity<sup>8</sup>. Here we report the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy Leo P (refs. <sup>9,10</sup>) with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) observing mode. These observations place a lower limit on Leo P's molecular gas content, and modelling of the photodissociation region illuminated by the O star suggests a compact (≤2.6 pc radius), approximately 10<sup>4</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> cloud. We also report a stringent upper limit on carbon monoxide (CO) emission from a deep search with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our results highlight the power of MIRI-MRS to characterize even small ultraviolet-illuminated molecular clouds in the low-metallicity regime, in which the traditional observational tracer CO is uninformative. This discovery pushes the limiting metallicity at which molecular gas is present in detectable quantities more than a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of the interstellar medium in early galaxies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09115-7
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Targeting GRPR for sex hormone-dependent cancer after loss of E-cadherin.,"Sex inequalities in cancer are well documented, but the current limited understanding is hindering advances in precision medicine and therapies<sup>1</sup>. Consideration of ethnicity, age and sex is essential for the management of cancer patients because they underlie important differences in both incidence and response to treatment<sup>2,3</sup>. Age-related hormone production, which is a consistent divergence between the sexes, is underestimated in cancers that are not recognized as being hormone dependent<sup>4-6</sup>. Here, we show that premenopausal women have increased vulnerability to cancers, and we identify the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a crucial component in the oestrogen response in various cancers, including melanoma. In a mouse model of melanoma, we discovered an oestrogen-sensitizing pathway connecting E-cadherin, β-catenin, oestrogen receptor-α and GRPR that promotes melanoma aggressiveness in women. Inhibiting this pathway by targeting GRPR or oestrogen receptor-α reduces metastasis in mice, indicating its therapeutic potential. Our study introduces a concept linking hormone sensitivity and tumour phenotype in which hormones affect cell phenotype and aggressiveness. We have identified an integrated pro-tumour pathway in women and propose that targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor with drugs not commonly used for cancer treatment could be more effective in treating E-cadherin-dependent cancers in women. This study emphasizes the importance of sex-specific factors in cancer management and offers hope of improving outcomes in various cancers.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09111-x
Nature,2025-Jun-11,A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime.,"Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models<sup>1</sup>, which are fundamental to modern condensed-matter physics<sup>2,3</sup>. Despite notable advancements<sup>4-6</sup>, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogues are still too high to address many open problems<sup>7-10</sup>. Here we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature<sup>6,11-13</sup>, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low-entropy product state into strongly correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters<sup>14,15</sup>, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically<sup>10</sup>. At half-filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturation, leading to a temperature of <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>T</mi> <mo>/</mo> <mi>t</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.0</mn> <msubsup><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>0.05</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>+</mo> <mn>0.06</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </mrow> </math> based on comparisons with numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations<sup>9</sup>. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations<sup>16-18</sup>. Compared with the cuprates<sup>2,19,20</sup>, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, at which physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected<sup>3,19,21-24</sup>. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics<sup>8,10</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09112-w
Nature,2025-Jun-11,SP140-RESIST pathway regulates interferon mRNA stability and antiviral immunity.,"Type I interferons are essential for antiviral immunity<sup>1</sup> but must be tightly regulated<sup>2</sup>. The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon-β (Ifnb1) expression through an unknown mechanism<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we report that SP140 does not directly repress Ifnb1 transcription. Instead, SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator that we call RESIST (regulated stimulator of interferon via stabilization of transcript; previously annotated as annexin 2 receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within punctate structures called nuclear bodies that have important roles in silencing DNA-virus gene expression in the nucleus<sup>3</sup>. Consistent with this observation, we find that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 is independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1. Our results establish dual antiviral and interferon regulatory functions for SP140. We propose that SP140 and RESIST participate in antiviral effector-triggered immunity<sup>5,6</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09152-2
Nature,2025-Jun-11,A fully open AI foundation model applied to chest radiography.,"Chest radiography frequently serves as baseline imaging for most lung diseases<sup>1</sup>. Deep learning has great potential for automating the interpretation of chest radiography<sup>2</sup>. However, existing chest radiographic deep learning models are limited in diagnostic scope, generalizability, adaptability, robustness and extensibility. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Ark<sup>+</sup>, a foundation model applied to chest radiography and pretrained by cyclically accruing and reusing the knowledge from heterogeneous expert labels in numerous datasets. Ark<sup>+</sup> excels in diagnosing thoracic diseases. It expands the diagnostic scope and addresses potential misdiagnosis. It can adapt to evolving diagnostic needs and respond to novel diseases. It can learn rare conditions from a few samples and transfer to new diagnostic settings without training. It tolerates data biases and long-tailed distributions, and it supports federated learning to preserve privacy. All codes and pretrained models have been released, so that Ark<sup>+</sup> is open for fine-tuning, local adaptation and improvement. It is extensible to several modalities. Thus, it is a foundation model for medical imaging. The exceptional capabilities of Ark<sup>+</sup> stem from our insight: aggregating various datasets diversifies the patient populations and accrues knowledge from many experts to yield unprecedented performance while reducing annotation costs<sup>3</sup>. The development of Ark<sup>+</sup> reveals that open models trained by accruing and reusing knowledge from heterogeneous expert annotations with a multitude of public (big or small) datasets can surpass the performance of proprietary models trained on large data. We hope that our findings will inspire more researchers to share code and datasets or federate privacy-preserving data to create open foundation models with diverse, global expertise and patient populations, thus accelerating open science and democratizing AI for medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09079-8
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Probing phonon transport dynamics across an interface by electron microscopy.,"Understanding thermal transport mechanisms across material interfaces is crucial for advancing semiconductor technologies, particularly in miniaturized devices operating under extreme power densities<sup>1,2</sup>. Although the interface phonon-mediated processes are theoretically established<sup>3-6</sup> as the dominant mechanism for interfacial thermal transport in semiconductors<sup>7</sup>, their nanoscale dynamics remain experimentally elusive owing to challenges in measuring the temperature and non-equilibrium phonon distributions across the buried interface<sup>8-11</sup>. Here we overcome these limitations by using in situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an electron microscope to nanoscale profile temperature gradients across the AlN-SiC interface during thermal transport and map its non-equilibrium phonon occupations at sub-nanometre resolution. We observe a sharp temperature drop within about 2 nm across the interface, enabling direct extraction of relative interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). During thermal transport, the mismatch of phonon modes' thermal conductivity at the interface causes substantial non-equilibrium phonons nearby, making the populations of interface modes different under forward and reverse heat flow and also leading to marked changes in the modal temperature of AlN optical phonons within about 3 nm of the interface. These results reveal the phonon transport dynamics at the (sub-)nanoscale and establish the inelastic phonon scattering mechanism involved by interface modes, offering valuable insights into the engineering of thermal interfaces.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09108-6
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Dynamic assemblies and coordinated reactions of non-homologous end joining.,"Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the main repair pathway of double-strand DNA breaks in higher eukaryotes<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we report reconstitution of the final steps of NHEJ and structures of DNA polymerase μ and ligase IV (LIG4) engaged in gap filling and end joining. These reactions take place in a flexible ω-shaped framework composed of XRCC4 and XLF. Two broken DNA ends, each encircled by Ku70-Ku80 internally, are docked onto the ω frame, mediated by LIG4. DNA polymerase and ligase attached to each ω arm repair only one broken strand of a defined polarity; the final steps of NHEJ requires coordination and toggling of a pair of such enzymes. The facilitators XLF and PAXX additively stimulate NHEJ reactions. As DNA-end sensor and protector, LIG4 replaces DNA-PKcs for end joining and bridges the two DNA ends for polymerase to fill remaining gaps. These assemblies present new targets for NHEJ inhibition to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and accuracy of gene editing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09078-9
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Weakly space-confined all-inorganic perovskites for light-emitting diodes.,"Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs)<sup>1-4</sup>. Spatially confining charge carriers using nanocrystal/quantum dots<sup>5-9</sup>, low-dimensional perovskites<sup>10-13</sup> and ultrathin perovskite layers<sup>14</sup> have all been used to improve the external quantum efficiency of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). However, most strongly space-confined perovskites suffer from severe Auger recombination, ion migration and thermal instability, resulting in limited brightness and operational lifetime<sup>6,7,10-12,14-17</sup>. Here, we report an alternative strategy based on weakly space-confined, large-grained crystals of all-inorganic perovskite. Sacrificial additives, namely, hypophosphorous acid and ammonium chloride, were used to induce nucleation and crystallization of caesium lead bromide, resulting in monocrystal grains with minimized trap density and a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Benefiting from the high carrier mobility and suppressed Auger recombination, we obtained efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency reaching 22.0%, which remained above 20% at a high current density near 1,000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a brightness of over 1,167,000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, benefiting from the suppressed ion migration and better thermal stability, the extrapolated half-lifetime of the weakly space-confined PeLEDs increased to 185,600 h under an initial luminance of 100 cd m<sup>-2</sup> at room temperature. Our work is a new approach for designing efficient, bright and stable PeLEDs for real applications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09137-1
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Rapid emergence of a maths gender gap in first grade.,"Preventing gender disparities in mathematics is a worldwide preoccupation<sup>1,2</sup>. In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space<sup>3-8</sup>. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that 'girls are bad at maths'. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4 months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1 year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09126-4
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Glycosaminoglycan-driven lipoprotein uptake protects tumours from ferroptosis.,"Lipids are essential components of cancer cells due to their structural and signalling roles<sup>1</sup>. To meet metabolic demands, many cancers take up extracellular lipids<sup>2-5</sup>; however, how these lipids contribute to cancer growth and progression remains poorly understood. Here, using functional genetic screens, we identify uptake of lipoproteins-the primary mechanism for lipid transport in circulation-as a key determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer. Lipoprotein supplementation robustly inhibits ferroptosis across diverse cancer types, primarily through the delivery of α-tocopherol (α-toc), the most abundant form of vitamin E in human lipoproteins. Mechanistically, cancer cells take up lipoproteins through a pathway dependent on sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to cell-surface proteoglycans. Disrupting GAG biosynthesis or acutely degrading surface GAGs reduces lipoprotein uptake, sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis and impairs tumour growth in mice. Notably, human clear cell renal cell carcinomas-a lipid-rich malignancy-exhibit elevated levels of chondroitin sulfate and increased lipoprotein-derived α-toc compared with normal kidney tissue. Together, our study establishes lipoprotein uptake as a critical anti-ferroptotic mechanism in cancer and implicates GAG biosynthesis as a therapeutic target.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09162-0
Nature,2025-Jun-11,RIFINs displayed on malaria-infected erythrocytes bind KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1.,"Natural killer (NK) cells use inhibitory and activating immune receptors to differentiate between human cells and pathogens. Signalling by these receptors determines whether an NK cell becomes activated and destroys a target cell. In some cases, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, immune receptors are found in pairs, with inhibitory and activating receptors containing nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains coupled to different intracellular signalling domains<sup>1</sup>. Previous studies showed that repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, displayed on the surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, can bind to inhibitory immune receptors and dampen NK cell activation<sup>2,3</sup>, reducing parasite killing. However, no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for any human activating receptor. Here we identified a clade of RIFINs that bind to inhibitory immune receptor KIR2DL1 more strongly than KIR2DL1 binds to the human ligand (MHC class I). This interaction mediates inhibitory signalling and suppresses the activation of KIR2DL1-expressing NK cells. We show that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs are abundant in field-isolated strains from both Africa and Asia and reveal how the two RIFINs bind to KIR2DL1. The RIFIN binding surface of KIR2DL1 is conserved in the cognate activating immune receptor KIR2DS1. We find that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs can also bind to KIR2DS1, resulting in the activation of KIR2DS1-expressing NK cells. This study demonstrates that activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors can recruit NK cells to target a pathogen and reveals a potential role for activating immune receptors in controlling malaria infection.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09091-y
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Discovery of FoTO1 and Taxol genes enables biosynthesis of baccatin III.,"Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules<sup>1,2</sup>, but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees (Taxus species)<sup>3</sup>. Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research<sup>4</sup>. Within Taxus' large, enzyme-rich genome<sup>5</sup>, we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3'-N-debenzoyl-2'-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09090-z
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Attosecond inner-shell lasing at ångström wavelengths.,"Since the invention of the laser, nonlinear effects such as filamentation<sup>1</sup>, Rabi cycling<sup>2,3</sup> and collective emission<sup>4</sup> have been explored in the optical regime, leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications<sup>5-8</sup>. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have extended many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of ångström-scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity<sup>9</sup>. An example is XFEL-driven inner-shell Kα<sub>1</sub> (2p<sub>3/2</sub> → 1s<sub>1/2</sub>) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been used for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of new X-ray laser sources<sup>10-16</sup>. Here we show that strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5-2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity (>10<sup>19</sup> W cm<sup>-2</sup>) XFEL-driven Kα<sub>1</sub> lasing of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal XFEL pump pulse substructure, the resulting X-ray pulses (about 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> photons) can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities and spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Three-dimensional Maxwell-Bloch calculations<sup>17</sup> show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation and that the broad spectral features are driven by sub-femtosecond Rabi cycling. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that provide opportunities for quantum X-ray optics applications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09105-9
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Developmental trajectory and evolutionary origin of thymic mimetic cells.,"The generation of self-tolerant repertoires of T cells depends on the expression of peripheral self antigens in the thymic epithelium<sup>1</sup> and the presence of small populations of cells that mimic the diverse phenotypes of peripheral tissues<sup>2-7</sup>. Whereas the molecular underpinnings of self-antigen expression have been extensively studied<sup>8</sup>, the developmental origins and differentiation pathways of thymic mimetic cells remain to be identified. Moreover, the histological identification of myoid and other peripheral cell types as components of the thymic microenvironment of many vertebrate species<sup>9</sup> raises questions regarding the evolutionary origin of this unique tolerance mechanism. Here we show that during mouse development, mimetic cells appear in the microenvironment in two successive waves. Cells that exhibit transcriptional signatures characteristic of muscle, ionocyte, goblet and ciliated cells emerge before birth, whereas others, such as those that mimic enterohepatic cells and skin keratinocytes, appear postnatally. These two groups also respond differently to modulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools caused by deletions of Foxn1 and Ascl1, expression of a hypomorphic variant of the transcription factor FOXN1, and overexpression of the signalling molecules BMP4 and FGF7. Differences in mimetic cell populations were also observed in thymic microenvironments reconstructed by replacement of mouse Foxn1 with evolutionarily ancient Foxn1/4 gene family members, including the Foxn4 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the Foxn4 and Foxn1 genes of a cartilaginous fish. Whereas some cell types, such as ciliated cells, develop in the thymus in the absence of FOXN1, mimetic cells that appear postnatally, such as enterohepatic cells, require the activity of the vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1. The thymus of cartilaginous fishes and the thymoid of lampreys, a representative of jawless vertebrates, which exhibit an alternative adaptive immune system<sup>10</sup>, also harbour cells that express genes encoding peripheral tissue components such as the liver-specific protein transthyretin. Our findings suggest an evolutionary model of successive changes of thymic epithelial genetic networks enabling the coordinated contribution of peripheral antigen expression and mimetic cell formation to achieve central tolerance for vertebrate-specific innovations of tissues such as the liver<sup>11,12</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09148-y
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Traceable random numbers from a non-local quantum advantage.,"The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital security<sup>1,2</sup> and applications that fairly distribute resources<sup>3,4</sup>. However, existing random number generators have limitations-the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators<sup>5</sup> are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators<sup>6-9</sup> can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol forms the basis for a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched<sup>10</sup>. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7,434 out of 7,454 attempts-a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error multiplied by actual success probability bounded by 2<sup>-64</sup>. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents a public service that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09054-3
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Early life high fructose impairs microglial phagocytosis and neurodevelopment.,"Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment<sup>1-3</sup>. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central nervous system<sup>4</sup>. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents-an effect that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that high-fructose exposure during early life is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09098-5
Nature,2025-Jun-11,A new Mongolian tyrannosauroid and the evolution of Eutyrannosauria.,"Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the 'middle' Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth<sup>4-10</sup>, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted<sup>11-19</sup>. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends-paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively-allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08964-6
Nature,2025-Jun-10,Silicate clouds and a circumplanetary disk in the YSES-1 exoplanet system.,"Young exoplanets provide a critical link between understanding planet formation and atmospheric evolution<sup>1</sup>. Direct imaging spectroscopy allows us to infer the properties of young, wide orbit, giant planets with high signal-to-noise. This allows us to compare this young population to exoplanets characterized with transmission spectroscopy, which has indirectly revealed the presence of clouds<sup>2-4</sup>, photochemistry<sup>5</sup>, and a diversity of atmospheric compositions<sup>6-7</sup>. Direct detections have also been made for brown dwarfs<sup>8-9</sup>, but direct studies of young giant planets in the mid-infrared were not possible prior to JWST<sup>10</sup>. With two exoplanets around a solar type star, the YSES-1 system is an ideal laboratory for studying this early phase of exoplanet evolution. We report the first direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c through its 9-11 µm absorption feature, and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet, YSES-1 b. The clouds of YSES-1 c are composed of either amorphous iron-enriched pyroxene or a combination of amorphous MgSiO<sub>3</sub> and Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, with particle sizes of ≤0.1 μm at 1 millibar of pressure. We attribute the emission from the disk around YSES-1 b to be from submicron olivine dust grains, which may have formed through collisions of planet-forming bodies in the disk.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09174-w
Nature,2025-Jun-09,NINJ1 regulates plasma membrane fragility under mechanical strain.,"Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning<sup>1</sup>. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage<sup>2</sup>, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death<sup>3,4</sup>, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09222-5
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Probing condensate microenvironments with a micropeptide killswitch.,"Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm<sup>1-5</sup>. However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited<sup>6-9</sup>. Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09141-5
Nature,2025-Jun-04,CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy offers a promising approach against cancer<sup>1-3</sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA-CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09087-8
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Molecular gradients shape synaptic specificity of a visuomotor transformation.,"How does the brain convert visual input into specific motor actions<sup>1,2</sup>? In Drosophila, visual projection neurons (VPNs)<sup>3,4</sup> perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain<sup>5</sup>. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. <sup>6</sup>), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain<sup>7</sup> and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09037-4
Nature,2025-Jun-04,A soft-clamped topological waveguide for phonons.,"Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed-matter systems. Recently, this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons<sup>1</sup> and phonons<sup>2</sup>, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits<sup>2,3</sup>. In principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB cm<sup>-1</sup> level for phononic waveguides, whether topological<sup>4-7</sup> or not<sup>8-19</sup>. Here we combine advanced dissipation engineering<sup>20</sup>-in particular, the recently introduced method of soft clamping<sup>21</sup>-with the concept of valley-Hall topological insulators for phonons<sup>22-26</sup>. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses due to dissipation of 3 dB km<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. The low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in topological phononic waveguides, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120° bend with a 99.99% probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. Our work will inspire new research directions on ultralow-loss phononic waveguides and will provide a clean bosonic system for investigating topological protection and non-Hermitian topological physics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09092-x
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Ischaemic endothelial necroptosis induces haemolysis and COVID-19 angiopathy.,"Microangiopathy is a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the acute and chronic complications of the disease<sup>1</sup>. Endotheliopathy and dysregulated blood coagulation are prominent in COVID-19 and are considered to be major causes of microvascular obstruction<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we demonstrate extensive endothelial cell (EC) death in the microvasculature of COVID-19 organs. Notably, EC death was not associated with fibrin formation or platelet deposition, but was linked to microvascular red blood cell (RBC) haemolysis. Importantly, this RBC microangiopathy was associated with ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and was prominent in the microvasculature of humans with myocardial infarction, gut ischaemia, stroke, and septic and cardiogenic shock. Mechanistically, ischaemia induced MLKL-dependent EC necroptosis and complement-dependent RBC haemolysis. Deposition of haemolysed RBC membranes at sites of EC death resulted in the development of a previously unrecognized haemostatic mechanism preventing microvascular bleeding. Exaggeration of this haemolytic response promoted RBC aggregation and microvascular obstruction. Genetic deletion of Mlkl from ECs decreased RBC haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and reduced ischaemic organ injury. Our studies demonstrate the existence of a RBC haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs, functioning independently of platelets and fibrin. Therapeutic targeting of this haemolytic process may reduce microvascular obstruction in COVID-19, and other major human diseases associated with organ ischaemia.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09076-x
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Loss of colonic fidelity enables multilineage plasticity and metastasis.,"Cancer cell plasticity enables the acquisition of new phenotypic features and is implicated as a major driver of metastatic progression<sup>1,2</sup>. Metastasis occurs mostly in the absence of additional genetic alterations<sup>3-5</sup>, which suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are important<sup>6</sup>. However, they remain poorly defined. Here we identify the chromatin-remodelling enzyme ATRX as a key regulator of colonic lineage fidelity and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Atrx loss promotes tumour invasion and metastasis, concomitant with a loss of colonic epithelial identity and the emergence of highly plastic mesenchymal and squamous-like cell states. Combined analysis of chromatin accessibility and enhancer mapping identified impairment of activity of the colonic lineage-specifying transcription factor HNF4A as a key mediator of these observed phenotypes. We identify squamous-like cells in human patient samples and a squamous-like expression signature that correlates with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis. Collectively, our study defines the epigenetic maintenance of colonic epithelial identity by ATRX and HNF4A as suppressors of lineage plasticity and metastasis in colorectal cancer.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09125-5
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Increased CSF drainage by non-invasive manipulation of cervical lymphatics.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space around the brain drains to lymph nodes in the neck, but the connections and regulation have been challenging to identify<sup>1-24</sup>. Here we used fluorescent tracers in Prox1-GFP lymphatic reporter mice to map the pathway of CSF outflow through lymphatics to superficial cervical lymph nodes. CSF entered initial lymphatics in the meninges at the skull base and continued through extracranial periorbital, olfactory, nasopharyngeal and hard palate lymphatics, and then through smooth muscle-covered superficial cervical lymphatics to submandibular lymph nodes. Tracer studies in adult mice revealed that a substantial amount of total CSF outflow to the neck drained to superficial cervical lymph nodes. However, aged mice had fewer lymphatics in the nasal mucosa and hard palate and reduced CSF outflow to cervical lymph nodes. Superficial cervical lymphatics in aged mice had increased endothelial cell expression of Nos3, encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but had less eNOS protein and impaired nitric oxide signalling. Manipulation of superficial cervical lymphatics through intact skin by a force-regulated mechanical device doubled CSF outflow and corrected drainage impairment in aged mice. This manipulation increased CSF outflow by compressing superficial cervical lymphatics while having little effect on their normal spontaneous contractions. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of superficial cervical lymphatics for CSF outflow and the potential for reversing CSF drainage impairment by non-invasive mechanical stimulation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09052-5
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Ancient DNA reveals a two-clanned matrilineal community in Neolithic China.,"Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality<sup>1-10</sup>. Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 BCE. Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology<sup>11</sup>, not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09103-x
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Maternal iron deficiency causes male-to-female sex reversal in mouse embryos.,"Ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe<sup>2+</sup>-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc-which is required for iron incorporation-in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09063-2
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Subnucleosome preference of human chromatin remodeller SMARCAD1.,"Chromatin remodellers are pivotal in the regulation of nucleosome dynamics in cells, and they are important for chromatin packaging, transcription, replication and DNA repair<sup>1</sup>. Here we show that the human chromatin remodeller SMARCAD1 exhibits a substrate preference for subnucleosomal particles over the canonical nucleosome. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of SMARCAD1 bound to the nucleosome and hexasome provide mechanistic insights into the substrate selectivity. SMARCAD1 binds to the hexasome through multiple family-specific elements that are essential for the functions in vitro and in cells. The enzyme binds to the canonical nucleosome in an inactive conformation, which accounts for its diminished activity towards the nucleosome. Notably, the histone chaperone FACT complex acts synergistically with H2A-H2B to promote the activity of SMARCAD1 in nucleosome remodelling. Together, our findings reveal an avenue for chromatin regulation, whereby subnucleosomes are remodelled through an ATP-dependent process.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09100-0
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Concurrent loss of the Y chromosome in cancer and T cells impacts outcome.,"Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is the most common somatic alteration in men and is associated with higher mortality from epithelial cancers<sup>1-3</sup>. In tumours, epithelial LOY is also associated with poor survival<sup>4-7</sup>. This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09071-2
Nature,2025-Jun-04,Structural insights into human Pol III transcription initiation in action.,"RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters<sup>1-7</sup>. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)<sup>8-11</sup> and elongation complex (EC)<sup>12-16</sup> have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4-13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6-13). Together with KMnO<sub>4</sub> footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC-EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA-DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC-EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation-elongation transition for an RNA polymerase.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09093-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Impacts of climate change on global agriculture accounting for adaptation.,"Climate change threatens global food systems<sup>1</sup>, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial<sup>2</sup>. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small<sup>3,4</sup>, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe<sup>5,6</sup>. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity<sup>7-9</sup>, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 10<sup>14</sup> kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor<sup>10,11</sup>, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09085-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Vertically stacked monolithic perovskite colour photodetectors.,"Modern colour image sensors face challenges in further improving sensitivity and image quality because of inherent limitations in light utilization efficiency<sup>1</sup>. A major factor contributing to these limitations is the use of passive optical filters, which absorb and dissipate a substantial amount of light, thereby reducing the efficiency of light capture<sup>2</sup>. On the contrary, active optical filtering in Foveon-type vertically stacked architectures still struggles to deliver optimal performance owing to their lack of colour selectivity, making them inefficient for precise colour imaging<sup>3</sup>. Here we introduce an innovative architecture for colour sensor arrays that uses multilayer monolithically stacked lead halide perovskite thin-film photodetectors. Perovskite bandgap tunability<sup>4</sup> is utilized to selectively absorb the visible light spectrum's red, green and blue regions, eliminating the need for colour filters. External quantum efficiencies of 50%, 47% and 53% are demonstrated for the red, green and blue channels, respectively, as well as a colour accuracy of 3.8% in ΔE<sub>Lab</sub> outperforming the state-of-the-art colour-filter array and Foveon-type photosensors. The image sensor design improves light utilization in colour sensors and paves the way for the next generation of highly sensitive, artefact-free images with enhanced colour fidelity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09062-3
Nature,2025-Jun,Abyssal seafloor as a key driver of ocean trace-metal biogeochemical cycles.,"Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important to marine life and are essential tools for studying ocean processes<sup>1</sup>. Two different frameworks have arisen regarding marine TEI cycling: reversible scavenging favours water-column control on TEI distributions<sup>2-5</sup>, and seafloor boundary exchange emphasizes sedimentary imprints on water-column biogeochemistry<sup>6,7</sup>. These two views lead to disparate interpretations of TEI behaviours<sup>8-10</sup>. Here we use rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes as exemplar tracers of particle scavenging<sup>11</sup> and boundary exchange<sup>6,7,12</sup>. We integrate these data with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis to propose a general framework for marine TEI cycling. We show that, for elements with greater affinity for manganese oxide than biogenic particles, scavenging is a net sink throughout the water column, contrary to a common assumption for reversible scavenging<sup>3,13</sup>. In this case, a benthic flux supports increasing elemental concentrations with water depth. This sedimentary source consists of two components: one recycled from elements scavenged by water-column particles, and another newly introduced to the water column through marine silicate weathering inside sediment<sup>8,14,15</sup>. Abyssal oxic diagenesis drives this benthic source, and exerts a strong influence on water-column biogeochemistry through seafloor geometry and bottom-intensified turbulent mixing<sup>16,17</sup>. Our findings affirm the role of authigenic minerals, often overshadowed by biogenic particles, in water-column cycling<sup>18</sup>, and suggest that the abyssal seafloor, often regarded as inactive, is a focus of biogeochemical transformation<sup>19,20</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09038-3
Nature,2025-Jun,Preparation of a neutral nitrogen allotrope hexanitrogen C<sub>2h</sub>-N<sub>6</sub>.,"Compounds consisting only of the element nitrogen (polynitrogens or nitrogen allotropes) are considered promising clean energy-storage materials owing to their immense energy content that is much higher than hydrogen, ammonia or hydrazine, which are in common use, and because they release only harmless nitrogen on decomposition<sup>1</sup>. However, their extreme instability poses a substantial synthetic challenge and no neutral molecular nitrogen allotrope beyond N<sub>2</sub> has been isolated<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we present the room-temperature preparation of molecular N<sub>6</sub> (hexanitrogen) through the gas-phase reaction of chlorine or bromine with silver azide, followed by trapping in argon matrices at 10 K. We also prepared neat N<sub>6</sub> as a film at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), further indicating its stability. Infrared and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, <sup>15</sup>N-isotope labelling and ab initio computations firmly support our findings. The preparation of a metastable molecular nitrogen allotrope beyond N<sub>2</sub> contributes to our fundamental scientific knowledge and possibly opens new opportunities for future energy-storage concepts.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09032-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Physical restoration of a painting with a digitally constructed mask.,"Conservation of damaged oil paintings requires manual inpainting of losses<sup>1,2</sup>, leading to months-long treatments of considerable expense; 70% of paintings in institutional collections are locked away from public view, in part because of treatment cost<sup>3,4</sup>. Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them<sup>5-8</sup>. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm<sup>2</sup> and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09045-4
Nature,2025-Jun,A complementary two-dimensional material-based one instruction set computer.,"Silicon has enabled advancements in semiconductor technology through miniaturization, but scaling challenges necessitate the exploration of new materials<sup>1</sup>. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic thickness and high carrier mobility, offer a promising alternative<sup>2-5</sup>. Although significant progress has been made in wafer-scale growth<sup>6-8</sup>, high-performance field-effect transistors<sup>9-20</sup> and circuits based on 2D materials<sup>21-23</sup>, achieving complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integration remains a challenge. Here, we present a 2D one instruction set computer based on CMOS technology, leveraging the heterogeneous integration of large-area n-type MoS<sub>2</sub> and p-type WSe<sub>2</sub> field-effect transistors. By scaling the channel length, incorporating a high-κ gate dielectric and optimizing material growth and device postprocessing, we tailored the threshold voltages for both n- and p-type 2D field-effect transistors, achieving high drive currents and reduced subthreshold leakage. This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ. Finally, we projected the performance of the one instruction set computer and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art silicon technology using an industry-standard SPICE-compatible BSIM-BULK model. This model was calibrated with experimental data that incorporate device-to-device variations. Although further advances are needed, this work marks a significant milestone in the application of 2D materials to microelectronics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08963-7
Nature,2025-Jun,Observation of string breaking on a (2 + 1)D Rydberg quantum simulator.,"Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons<sup>1</sup>. When quark-antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. Although these phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task<sup>2</sup>. Here we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays<sup>3-5</sup>. We show that a (2 + 1)-dimensional LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry<sup>6</sup>, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade<sup>7</sup>. Long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses and the string tension. We experimentally probe string breaking in equilibrium by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, distinguishing regions within the confined phase dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string-breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work provides opportunities for exploring phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09051-6
Nature,2025-Jun,A multidimensional distributional map of future reward in dopamine neurons.,"Midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) signal reward-prediction errors that teach recipient circuits about expected rewards<sup>1</sup>. However, DANs are thought to provide a substrate for temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning (RL), an algorithm that learns the mean of temporally discounted expected future rewards, discarding useful information about experienced distributions of reward amounts and delays<sup>2</sup>. Here we present time-magnitude RL (TMRL), a multidimensional variant of distributional RL that learns the joint distribution of future rewards over time and magnitude. We also uncover signatures of TMRL-like computations in the activity of optogenetically identified DANs in mice during behaviour. Specifically, we show that there is significant diversity in both temporal discounting and tuning for the reward magnitude across DANs. These features allow the computation of a two-dimensional, probabilistic map of future rewards from just 450 ms of the DAN population response to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, reward-time predictions derived from this code correlate with anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that similar information is used to guide decisions about when to act. Finally, by simulating behaviour in a foraging environment, we highlight the benefits of a joint probability distribution of reward over time and magnitude in the face of dynamic reward landscapes and internal states. These findings show that rich probabilistic reward information is learnt and communicated to DANs, and suggest a simple, local-in-time extension of TD algorithms that explains how such information might be acquired and computed.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09089-6
Nature,2025-Jun,Acetolysis for epoxy-amine carbon fibre-reinforced polymer recycling.,"Carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are used in many applications in the global energy transition, including for lightweighting aircraft and vehicles and in wind turbine blades, shipping containers and gas storage vessels<sup>1-4</sup>. Given the high cost and energy-intensive manufacture of CFRPs<sup>5-7</sup>, recycling strategies are needed that recover intact carbon fibres and the epoxy-amine resin components. Here we show that acetic acid efficiently depolymerizes both aliphatic and aromatic epoxy-amine thermosets used in CFRPs to recoverable monomers, yielding pristine carbon fibres. Deconstruction of materials from multiple sectors demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, providing clean fibres from 2 h reactions. The optimal conditions were scaled to 80.0 g of post-consumer CFRPs, and demonstrative composites were fabricated from the recycled carbon fibres, which were recycled two more times, maintaining their strength throughout. Process modelling and techno-economic analysis, with feedstock cost informed by wind turbine blade waste generation<sup>8</sup>, indicates this method is cost effective, with a minimum selling price of US$1.50 per kg for recycled carbon fibres whereas life cycle assessment shows process greenhouse gas emissions around 99% lower than virgin carbon fibre production. Overall, this approach could enable recycling of industrial CFRPs as it provides clean, mechanically viable recycled carbon fibres and recoverable resin monomers from the thermoset.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09067-y
Nature,2025-Jun,Milli-spinner thrombectomy.,"Clot-induced blockage in arteries or veins can cause severe medical conditions<sup>1</sup>. Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive technique used to treat ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular disease<sup>2-4</sup> by removing clots through aspiration<sup>5</sup>, stent retriever<sup>6</sup> or cutting mechanisms<sup>7</sup>. However, current mechanical thrombectomy methods fail to remove clots in 10-30% of patients<sup>8-10</sup>, especially in the case of large, fibrin-rich clots<sup>11</sup>. These methods can also rupture and fragment clots<sup>12</sup>, causing distal emboli and poor outcomes<sup>13</sup>. To overcome these challenges, we develop the milli-spinner thrombectomy, which uses a simple yet innovative mechanics concept to modify the clot's microstructure, facilitating its removal. The milli-spinner works by mechanically densifying the clot's fibrin network and releasing red blood cells through spinning-induced compression and shear forces. It can shrink the clot volume by 95% for easy and fast removal. In vitro tests in pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in vivo experiments in swine models demonstrate that the milli-spinner achieves ultrafast clot debulking and high-fidelity revascularization, outperforming aspiration thrombectomy. The milli-spinner thrombectomy directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, improving mechanical thrombectomy success rates compared with current methods that rely on clot rupture or cutting. This approach offers a promising new direction for mechanical thrombectomy devices, especially for treating ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombosis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09049-0
Nature,2025-Jun,Coordination environments of Pt single-atom catalysts from NMR signatures.,"Supported metal catalysts that integrate atomically dispersed species with controlled structures lie at the forefront of catalytic materials design, offering exceptional control over reactivity and high metal utilization, approaching the precision of molecular systems<sup>1-3</sup>. However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure-activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications<sup>1,2</sup>. Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that <sup>195</sup>Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures. Beyond SACs, this approach lays the foundation for studying more complex architectures, such as dual-atom or single-cluster catalysts, containing various NMR-active metals.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09068-x

The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50-100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation<sup>10,11</sup>. Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air-sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region's main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08903-5
Nature,2025-Jun,Multi-timescale reinforcement learning in the brain.,"To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behaviour can be learned through reinforcement learning<sup>1</sup>, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents<sup>2-5</sup> and at characterizing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain<sup>6-8</sup>. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single timescale, known as the discount factor. Here we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopaminergic neurons in mice performing two behavioural tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks, suggesting that it is a cell-specific property. Together, our results provide a new paradigm for understanding functional heterogeneity in dopaminergic neurons and a mechanistic basis for the empirical observation that humans and animals use non-exponential discounts in many situations<sup>9-12</sup>, and open new avenues for the design of more-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08929-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Integrated photonic source of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits.,"Building a useful photonic quantum computer requires robust techniques to synthesize optical states that can encode qubits. Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states<sup>1</sup> offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations<sup>2</sup>. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states<sup>3</sup> and other complex non-Gaussian states<sup>4-11</sup> have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing<sup>2,12</sup>, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09044-5
Nature,2025-Jun,Visualizing dynamics of charges and strings in (2 + 1)D lattice gauge theories.,"Lattice gauge theories (LGTs)<sup>1-4</sup> can be used to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials<sup>5-7</sup>. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging, as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits<sup>8-10</sup>. Here we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <msub><mrow><mi>Z</mi></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </msub> </math> LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit that prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics by means of a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen<sup>11,12</sup>. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a new set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08999-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Warming accelerates global drought severity.,"Drought is one of the most common and complex natural hazards affecting the environment, economies and populations globally<sup>1-4</sup>. However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends<sup>4-6</sup>, and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901-2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018-2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981-2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09047-2
Nature,2025-Jun,Old carbon routed from land to the atmosphere by global river systems.,"Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere<sup>1,2</sup>. Until now, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration<sup>3-6</sup>. Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup>, similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09023-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Detection of X-ray emission from a bright long-period radio transient.,"Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission thousands of times longer than radio pulsars<sup>1-5</sup>. These findings, enabled by advances in wide-field radio surveys, challenge existing models of rotationally powered pulsars. Proposed models include highly magnetized neutron stars<sup>6</sup>, white-dwarf pulsars<sup>7</sup> and white-dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions<sup>8</sup>. Although some models predict X-ray emission<sup>6,9</sup>, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches<sup>1-5,10</sup>. Here we report the discovery of an extremely bright LPT (10-20 Jy in radio), ASKAP J1832-0911, which has coincident radio and X-ray emission, both with a 44.2-minute period. Its correlated and highly variable X-ray and radio luminosities, combined with other observational properties, are unlike any known Galactic object. The source could be an old magnetar or an ultra-magnetized white dwarf; however, both interpretations present theoretical challenges. This X-ray detection from an LPT reveals that these objects are more energetic than previously thought and establishes a class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients with a luminosity of about 10<sup>33</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> linked to exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09077-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Light-triggered regionally controlled n-doping of organic semiconductors.,"Doping is a primary method to modulate the electrical properties of semiconductors, enabling the fabrication of various homojunctions/heterojunctions and complex devices<sup>1-8</sup>. For organic semiconductors (OSCs), the electrical performance has been extensively improved by developing doping methods and dopants<sup>9-13</sup>. However, compared with the state-of-the-art spatial resolution of inorganic semiconductor fabrication processes, OSCs lag far behind, limiting the construction of complex organic electronic devices<sup>5</sup>. Here we present a facile light-triggered doping strategy and develop a series of inactive photoactivable dopants (iPADs) for regionally controlled n-doping of OSCs. By converting iPADs into active dopants through ultraviolet (UV) exposure, controllable doping of various n-type OSCs with high electrical conductivity greater than 30 S cm<sup>-1</sup> has been realized. Using iPADs can substantially improve the performances of OSCs in transistors, logic circuits and thermoelectrics. Also, regionally controlled doping is demonstrated in OSCs with a record resolution down to 1 μm. Overall, our strategy has achieved tunable doping levels in OSCs with high spatial resolution, which is expected to be highly suited for integrated circuits in both roll-to-roll and laboratory-scale environments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09075-y
Nature,2025-Jun,Unconventional solitonic high-temperature superfluorescence from perovskites.,"Fast thermal dephasing limits macroscopic quantum phenomena to cryogenic conditions<sup>1-4</sup> and hinders their use at ambient temperatures<sup>5,6</sup>. For electronic excitations in condensed media, dephasing is mediated by thermal lattice motion<sup>1,7,8</sup>. Therefore, taming the lattice influence is essential for creating collective electronic quantum states at high temperatures. Although there are occasional reports of high-T<sub>c</sub> quantum effects across different platforms, it is unclear which lattice characteristics and electron-lattice interactions lead to macroscopically coherent electronic states in solids<sup>9</sup>. Here we studied intensity fluctuations in the macroscopic polarization during the emergence of superfluorescence in a lead halide perovskite<sup>10</sup> and showed that spontaneously synchronized polaronic lattice oscillations accompany collective electronic dipole emission. We further developed an effective field model and theoretically confirmed that exciton-lattice interactions lead to a new electronically and structurally entangled coherent extended solitonic state beyond a critical polaron density. The analysis shows a phase transition with two processes happening in tandem: incoherent disordered polaronic lattice deformations establish an order, while macroscopic quantum coherence among excitons simultaneously emerges. Recombination of excitons in this state culminates in superfluorescence at high temperatures. Our study establishes fundamental connections between the transient superfluorescence process observed after the impulsive excitation of perovskites and general equilibrium phase transitions achieved by thermal cooling. By identifying various electron-lattice interactions in the perovskite structure and their respective role in creating collectively coherent electronic effects in solids, our work provides unprecedented insight into the design and development of new materials that exhibit high-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09030-x
Nature,2025-Jun,Global dominance of seasonality in shaping lake-surface-extent dynamics.,"Lakes are crucial for ecosystems<sup>1</sup>, greenhouse gas emissions<sup>2</sup> and water resources<sup>3</sup>, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations<sup>4,5</sup>. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes<sup>6-8</sup>, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001-2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user's and producer's accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset<sup>7</sup>. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world's population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes<sup>9</sup>, protecting lacustrine systems<sup>10-12</sup> and improving global climate models<sup>13,14</sup>. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09046-3
Nature,2025-Jun,Dating the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis using La-Ce geochronology.,"There is ongoing debate as to when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved on Earth<sup>1,2</sup>. Geochemical data from ancient sediments indicate localized or ephemeral photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> production before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) approximately 2.5-2.3 billion years ago (Ga), and currently suggest Archaean origins, approximately 3 Ga or earlier<sup>3-9</sup>. However, sedimentary records of the early Earth often suffer from preservation issues, and poor control on the timing of oxidation leaves geochemical proxy data for the ancient presence of O<sub>2</sub> open to critique<sup>10-13</sup>. Here, we report rare Earth element data from three different Archaean carbonate platforms preserved in greenstone belts of the northwest Superior Craton (Canada), which were deposited by the activity of marine photosynthetic bacteria 2.87 Ga, 2.85 Ga and 2.78 Ga. All three indicate O<sub>2</sub> production before the GOE in the form of significant depletions in cerium (Ce), reflecting oxidative Ce removal from ancient seawater, as occurs today<sup>14</sup>. Using <sup>138</sup>La-<sup>138</sup>Ce geochronology, we show that La/Ce fractionation, and thus Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, making these the oldest directly dated Ce anomalies. These results place the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier and bring an important new perspective on a long-standing debate regarding Earth's biological and geochemical evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09009-8
Nature,2025-Jun,Electrical switching of a p-wave magnet.,"Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electronvolt (eV)-scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications<sup>1,2</sup>. A variety of such magnetic states with non-trivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d-wave, g-wave or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets<sup>3-7</sup>. Achieving voltage-based control of the non-uniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energy-efficient and compact devices for information storage and processing<sup>8,9</sup>. Spin-spiral type II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order that directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry-protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order<sup>10-14</sup>. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principles calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI<sub>2</sub> exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent an observation of p-wave magnetism in a spin-spiral type II multiferroic, which may lead to the development of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09034-7
Nature,2025-Jun,Air pollution modulates trends and variability of the global methane budget.,"Air pollution affects climate through various complex interactions<sup>1</sup>. It perturbs the Earth's radiative energy balance and alters the atmospheric oxidation capacity, which determines the lifetimes of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane<sup>1</sup>. A key mechanism in this dynamic is the impact of air pollutants on the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidant in the troposphere, which accounts for approximately 90% of the methane chemical sink<sup>2</sup>. However, a comprehensive quantification of the interactions between air pollutants, OH and methane over decadal timescales remains incomplete<sup>2</sup>. Here we develop an integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach to quantify how variations in key air pollutants influence the methane chemical sink and alter the methane budget. Our results indicate that, from 2005 to 2021, enhanced tropospheric ozone, increased water vapour and decreased carbon monoxide levels collectively contributed to a 1.3-2.0 Tg year<sup>-1</sup> increase per year in the global methane sink, thereby buffering atmospheric methane growth rates. This increase in the methane sink was primarily concentrated in tropical regions and exhibited a north-south asymmetry. Periods of high methane growth were typically linked to abrupt OH level declines driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events such as mega wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study suggests a trade-off between O<sub>3</sub> pollution control and methane removal mediated by OH and highlights the risk of increasing carbon monoxide emissions from widespread wildfires.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09004-z
Nature,2025-Jun,Observing anyonization of bosons in a quantum gas.,"Anyons<sup>1,2</sup> are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states<sup>3-5</sup> and are believed to enable topological quantum computing<sup>6,7</sup>. One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here we observed emergent anyonic correlations in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, resulting from the phenomenon of spin-charge separation<sup>8-10</sup>. A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution<sup>11-14</sup>, a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons<sup>15</sup>. This study opens the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting<sup>15-17</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09016-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Sequence diversity lost in early pregnancy.,"Every generation, the human genome is shuffled during meiosis and a single fertilized egg gives rise to all of the cells of the body<sup>1</sup>. Meiotic errors leading to chromosomal abnormalities are known causes of pregnancy loss<sup>2,3</sup>, but genetic aetiologies of euploid pregnancy loss remain largely unexplained<sup>4</sup>. Here we characterize sequence diversity in early pregnancy loss through whole-genome sequencing of 1,007 fetal samples and 934 parental samples from 467 trios affected by pregnancy loss (fetus, mother and father). Sequenced parental genomes enabled us to determine both the parental and meiotic origins of chromosomal abnormalities, detected in half of our set. It further enabled us to assess de novo mutations on both homologous chromosomes from parents transmitting extra chromosomes, and date them, revealing that 6.6% of maternal mutations occurred before sister chromatid formation in fetal oocytes. We find a similar number of de novo mutations in the trios affected by pregnancy loss as in 9,651 adult trios, but three times the number of pathogenic small (<50 bp) sequence variant genotypes in the loss cases compared with adults. Overall, our findings indicate that around 1 in 136 pregnancies is lost due to a pathogenic small sequence variant genotype in the fetus. Our results highlight the vast sequence diversity that is lost in early pregnancy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09031-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Multigenerational cell tracking of DNA replication and heritable DNA damage.,"Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear<sup>1,2</sup>. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution<sup>3-5</sup>. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08986-0
Nature,2025-Jun,Unexpected clustering pattern in dwarf galaxies challenges formation models.,"The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space<sup>1,2</sup>. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in cold dark matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations<sup>3</sup> with the standard ΛCDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a ΛCDM framework<sup>4-6</sup>, and our finding provides clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter<sup>7</sup>, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08965-5
Nature,2025-Jun,The origin of vertebrate teeth and evolution of sensory exoskeletons.,"The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine<sup>1,2</sup>, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi<sup>3-5</sup>. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth<sup>3</sup>, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate<sup>6-8</sup> have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures<sup>9,10</sup>. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius<sup>11-13</sup> feature large dentine tubules<sup>1</sup> that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth<sup>14-16</sup>. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth<sup>16</sup>. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08944-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Molecular basis of positional memory in limb regeneration.,"The amputation of a salamander limb triggers anterior and posterior connective tissue cells to form distinct signalling centres that together fuel regeneration<sup>1</sup>. Anterior and posterior identities are established during development and are thought to persist for the whole life in the form of positional memory<sup>2</sup>. However, the molecular basis of positional memory and whether positional memory can be altered remain unknown. Here, we identify a positive-feedback loop that is responsible for posterior identity in the limb of an axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). Posterior cells express residual Hand2 transcription factor from development, and this primes them to form a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh signalling is also upstream of Hand2 expression. After regeneration, Shh is shut down but Hand2 is sustained, safeguarding posterior memory. We used this regeneration circuitry to convert anterior cells to a posterior-cell memory state. Transient exposure of anterior cells to Shh during regeneration kick-started an ectopic Hand2-Shh loop, leading to stable Hand2 expression and lasting competence to express Shh. Our results implicate positive-feedback in the stability of positional memory and reveal that positional memory is reprogrammed more easily in one direction (anterior to posterior) than in the other. Modifying positional memory in regenerative cells changes their signalling outputs, which has implications for tissue engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09036-5
Nature,2025-Jun,C-to-N atom swapping and skeletal editing in indoles and benzofurans.,"Skeletal editing comprises the structural reorganization of compounds. Such editing can be achieved through atom swapping, atom insertion, atom deletion or reorganization of the compound's backbone structure<sup>1,2</sup>. Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles. The compound classes obtained through these methods-indazoles<sup>3,4</sup>, benzisoxazoles<sup>5</sup>, benzimidazoles<sup>6,7</sup> and benzoxazoles<sup>8</sup>-are biologically relevant moieties found as substructures in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The procedures introduced substantially enlarge the methods portfolio in the emerging field of skeletal editing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09019-6
Nature,2025-Jun,The structure of liquid carbon elucidated by in situ X-ray diffraction.,"Carbon has a central role in biology and organic chemistry, and its solid allotropes provide the basis of much of our modern technology<sup>1</sup>. However, the liquid form of carbon remains nearly uncharted<sup>2</sup>, and the structure of liquid carbon and most of its physical properties are essentially unknown<sup>3</sup>. But liquid carbon is relevant for modelling planetary interiors<sup>4,5</sup> and the atmospheres of white dwarfs<sup>6</sup>, as an intermediate state for the synthesis of advanced carbon materials<sup>7,8</sup>, inertial confinement fusion implosions<sup>9</sup>, hypervelocity impact events on carbon materials<sup>10</sup> and our general understanding of structured fluids at extreme conditions<sup>11</sup>. Here we present a precise structure measurement of liquid carbon at pressures of around 1 million atmospheres obtained by in situ X-ray diffraction at an X-ray free-electron laser. Our results show a complex fluid with transient bonding and approximately four nearest neighbours on average, in agreement with quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The obtained data substantiate the understanding of the liquid state of one of the most abundant elements in the universe and can test models of the melting line. The demonstrated experimental abilities open the path to performing similar studies of the structure of liquids composed of light elements at extreme conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09035-6
Nature,2025-Jun,Ru and W isotope systematics in ocean island basalts reveals core leakage.,"The isotopic composition of lavas associated with mantle plumes has previously been interpreted in the light of core-mantle interaction, suggesting that mantle plumes may transport core material to Earth's surface<sup>1-5</sup>. However, a definitive fingerprint of Earth's core in the mantle remains unconfirmed. Precious metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), are highly concentrated in the metallic core but extremely depleted in the silicate mantle. Recently discovered mass-independent Ru isotope variations (ε<sup>100</sup>Ru) in ancient rocks show that the Ru isotope composition of accreted material changed during later stages of Earth's growth<sup>6</sup>, indicating that the core and mantle must have different Ru isotope compositions. This illustrates the potential of Ru isotopes as a new tracer for core-mantle interaction. Here we report Ru isotope anomalies for ocean island basalts. Basalts from Hawaii have higher ε<sup>100</sup>Ru than the ambient mantle. Combined with unradiogenic tungsten (W) isotope ratios, this is diagnostic of a core contribution to their mantle sources. The combined Ru and W isotope systematics of Hawaiian basalts are best explained by simple core entrainment but addition of core-derived oxide minerals at the core-mantle boundary is a possibility.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09003-0
Nature,2025-Jun,Targeting the SHOC2-RAS interaction in RAS-mutant cancers.,"Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer<sup>1</sup>. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses<sup>2</sup>. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants (* represents 'any'), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2-(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08931-1
Nature,2025-Jun,PLA2G15 is a BMP hydrolase and its targeting ameliorates lysosomal disease.,"Lysosomes catabolize lipids and other biological molecules, maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles, stimulates lipid-degrading enzymes and is altered in various human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases<sup>1,2</sup>. Although lysosomal BMP synthase was recently discovered<sup>3</sup>, the enzymes mediating BMP turnover remain elusive. Here we show that lysosomal phospholipase PLA2G15 is a physiological BMP hydrolase. We further demonstrate that the resistance of BMP to lysosomal hydrolysis arises from its unique sn2, sn2' esterification position and stereochemistry, as neither feature alone confers resistance. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes. Furthermore, PLA2G15 efficiently hydrolyses synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters, challenging the long-held thought that BMP stereochemistry alone ensures resistance to acid phospholipases. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters and S,S stereoconfiguration is stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient cells and tissues accumulate several BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wild-type PLA2G15 but not its inactive mutant. Targeting PLA2G15 reduces the cholesterol accumulation in fibroblasts of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 and significantly ameliorates disease pathologies in Niemann-Pick disease type C1-deficient mice, leading to an extended lifespan. Our findings established the rules governing BMP stability in lysosomes and identified PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08942-y
Nature,2025-Jun,Activation of lysosomal iron triggers ferroptosis in cancer.,"Iron catalyses the oxidation of lipids in biological membranes and promotes a form of cell death called ferroptosis<sup>1</sup>. Defining where this chemistry occurs in the cell can inform the design of drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis in various disease-relevant settings. Genetic approaches have revealed suppressors of ferroptosis<sup>2-4</sup>; by contrast, small molecules can provide spatiotemporal control of the chemistry at work<sup>5</sup>. Here we show that the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 exerts cytoprotective effects by inactivating iron in lysosomes. We also show that the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 initiates membrane lipid oxidation in lysosomes. We designed a small-molecule activator of lysosomal iron-fentomycin-1-to induce the oxidative degradation of phospholipids and ultimately ferroptosis. Fentomycin-1 is able to kill iron-rich CD44<sup>high</sup> primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which can promote metastasis and fuel drug tolerance. In such cells, iron regulates cell adaptation<sup>6,7</sup> while conferring vulnerability to ferroptosis<sup>8,9</sup>. Sarcoma cells exposed to sublethal doses of fentomycin-1 acquire a ferroptosis-resistant cell state characterized by the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the activation of a membrane-damage response. This phospholipid degrader can eradicate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells in vitro and reduces intranodal tumour growth in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Together, these results show that control of iron reactivity confers therapeutic benefits, establish lysosomal iron as a druggable target and highlight the value of targeting cell states<sup>10</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08974-4
Nature,2025-Jun,Light-microscopy-based connectomic reconstruction of mammalian brain tissue.,"The information-processing capability of the brain's cellular network depends on the physical wiring pattern between neurons and their molecular and functional characteristics. Mapping neurons and resolving their individual synaptic connections can be achieved by volumetric imaging at nanoscale resolution<sup>1,2</sup> with dense cellular labelling. Light microscopy is uniquely positioned to visualize specific molecules, but dense, synapse-level circuit reconstruction by light microscopy has been out of reach, owing to limitations in resolution, contrast and volumetric imaging capability. Here we describe light-microscopy-based connectomics (LICONN). We integrated specifically engineered hydrogel embedding and expansion with comprehensive deep-learning-based segmentation and analysis of connectivity, thereby directly incorporating molecular information into synapse-level reconstructions of brain tissue. LICONN will allow synapse-level phenotyping of brain tissue in biological experiments in a readily adoptable manner.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08985-1
Nature,2025-Jun,A cryptic role for reciprocal helping in a cooperatively breeding bird.,"Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology<sup>1</sup>. The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives<sup>2</sup>. Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based-nearly half of all avian<sup>3</sup> and mammalian<sup>4</sup> cooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans<sup>5</sup>. Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives<sup>6</sup>, but helpers also frequently assist non-kin<sup>7</sup>, highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies<sup>7,8</sup>. Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes-a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers' sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08958-4
Nature,2025-Jun,Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness.,"Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity<sup>1,2</sup>. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared<sup>3</sup>. Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT)<sup>4,5</sup> and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT)<sup>6-10</sup> via a theory-neutral consortium<sup>11-13</sup>. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof<sup>12</sup>. Human participants (n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here<sup>14-17</sup>. Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08888-1
Nature,2025-Jun,TIR domains produce histidine-ADPR as an immune signal in bacteria.,"Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains are central components of pattern recognition immune proteins across all domains of life<sup>1,2</sup>. In bacteria and plants, TIR-domain proteins recognize pathogen invasion and then produce immune signalling molecules exclusively comprising nucleotide moieties<sup>2-5</sup>. Here we show that the TIR-domain protein of the type II Thoeris defence system in bacteria produces a unique signalling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C terminus of the effector protein. By determining the crystal structure of a ligand-bound Macro domain, we describe the structural basis for His-ADPR and its recognition and show its role by biochemical and mutational analyses. Our analyses furthermore reveal a family of phage proteins that bind and sequester His-ADPR signalling molecules, enabling phages to evade TIR-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate diversity in bacterial TIR signalling and reveal a new class of TIR-derived immune signalling molecules that combine nucleotide and amino acid moieties.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08930-2
Nature,2025-Jun,Single-cell transcriptomics reveal how root tissues adapt to soil stress.,"Land plants thrive in soils showing vastly different properties and environmental stresses<sup>1</sup>. Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil conditions and stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic approaches, we showed major expression changes in outer root cell types when comparing the single-cell transcriptomes of rice roots grown in gel versus soil conditions. These tissue-specific transcriptional responses are related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity and defence in response to heterogeneous soil versus homogeneous gel growth conditions. We also demonstrate how the model soil stress, termed compaction, triggers expression changes in cell wall remodelling and barrier formation in outer and inner root tissues, regulated by abscisic acid released from phloem cells. Our study reveals how root tissues communicate and adapt to contrasting soil conditions at single-cell resolution.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08941-z
Nature,2025-Jun,Plant diversity dynamics over space and time in a warming Arctic.,"The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average<sup>1</sup> and plant communities are responding through shifts in species abundance, composition and distribution<sup>2-4</sup>. However, the direction and magnitude of local changes in plant diversity in the Arctic have not been quantified. Using a compilation of 42,234 records of 490 vascular plant species from 2,174 plots across the Arctic, here we quantified temporal changes in species richness and composition through repeat surveys between 1981 and 2022. We also identified the geographical, climatic and biotic drivers behind these changes. We found greater species richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, but no indication that, on average, species richness had changed directionally over time. However, species turnover was widespread, with 59% of plots gaining and/or losing species. Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness. Despite changes in plant composition, Arctic plant communities did not become more similar to each other, suggesting no biotic homogenization so far. Overall, Arctic plant communities changed in richness and composition in different directions, with temperature and plant-plant interactions emerging as the main drivers of change. Our findings demonstrate how climate and biotic drivers can act in concert to alter plant composition, which could precede future biodiversity changes that are likely to affect ecosystem function, wildlife habitats and the livelihoods of Arctic peoples<sup>5,6</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08946-8
Nature,2025-Jun,Diet outperforms microbial transplant to drive microbiome recovery in mice.,"A high-fat, low-fibre Western-style diet (WD) induces microbiome dysbiosis characterized by reduced taxonomic diversity and metabolic breadth<sup>1,2</sup>, which in turn increases risk for a wide array of metabolic<sup>3-5</sup>, immune<sup>6</sup> and systemic pathologies. Recent work has established that WD can impair microbiome resilience to acute perturbations such as antibiotic treatment<sup>7,8</sup>, although little is known about the mechanism of impairment and the specific consequences for the host of prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis. Here we characterize the trajectory by which the gut microbiome recovers its taxonomic and functional profile after antibiotic treatment in mice on regular chow (RC) or WD, and find that only mice on RC undergo a rapid successional process of recovery. Metabolic modelling indicates that a RC diet promotes the development of syntrophic cross-feeding interactions, whereas in mice on WD, a dominant taxon monopolizes readily available resources without releasing syntrophic byproducts. Intervention experiments reveal that an appropriate dietary resource environment is both necessary and sufficient for rapid and robust microbiome recovery, whereas microbial transplant is neither. Furthermore, prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis in mice on WD renders them susceptible to infection by the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Our data challenge widespread enthusiasm for faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a strategy to address dysbiosis, and demonstrate that specific dietary interventions are, at a minimum, an essential prerequisite for effective FMT, and may afford a safer, more natural and less invasive alternative.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08937-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Serotonin and neurotensin inputs in the vCA1 dictate opposing social valence.,"The ability to evaluate valence of a social agent based on social experience is essential for an animal's survival in its social group<sup>1</sup>. Although hippocampal circuits have been implicated in distinguishing novel and familiar conspecifics<sup>2-7</sup>, it remains unclear how social valence is constructed on the basis of social history and what mechanisms underlie the heightened valence versatility in dynamic relationships. Here we demonstrate that the ventral (v)CA1 integrates serotonin (5-HT) inputs from the dorsal raphe and neurotensin inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) to determine positive or negative valence of conspecific representations. Specifically, during an appetitive social interaction 5-HT is released into the vCA1 and disinhibits pyramidal neurons through 5-HT1<sub>B</sub> receptors, whereas neurotensin is released during an aversive social interaction and potentiates vCA1 neurons directly through NTR1s. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin inputs into the vCA1 impairs positive and negative social valence, respectively, and excitation flexibly switches valence assignment. These results show how aversive and rewarding social experiences are linked to conspecific identity through converging dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin signals in the vCA1 that instruct opposing valence, and represent a synaptic switch for flexible social valence computation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08809-2
Nature,2025-Jun,Global evolution of inflammatory bowel disease across epidemiologic stages.,"During the twentieth century, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered a disease of early industrialized regions in North America, Europe and Oceania<sup>1</sup>. At the turn of the twenty-first century, IBD incidence increased in newly industrialized and emerging regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the prevalence in early industrialized regions continued to grow steadily<sup>2-4</sup>. Changes in the incidence and prevalence denote the evolution of IBD across four epidemiologic stages: stage 1 (emergence), characterized by low incidence and prevalence; stage 2 (acceleration in incidence), marked by rapidly rising incidence and low prevalence; and stage 3 (compounding prevalence), where the incidence decelerates, plateaus or declines while the prevalence steadily increases. A fourth stage (prevalence equilibrium) has been proposed in which the prevalence slope plateaus due to demographic shifts in an ageing IBD population, but it has not yet been evidenced. To date, these stages have remained theoretical, lacking specific numerical indicators to define transition points. Here, using real-world data from 522 population-based studies encompassing 82 global regions and spanning more than a century (1920-2024), we show spatiotemporal transitions across stages 1-3 and model stage 4 progression. Understanding the evolution of IBD across epidemiologic stages enables healthcare systems to better anticipate the future worldwide burden of IBD.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08940-0
Nature,2025-Jun,Picuris Pueblo oral history and genomics reveal continuity in US Southwest.,"Indigenous groups often encounter significant challenges when asserting ancestral claims and cultural affiliations based on oral histories, particularly in the USA where such narratives have historically been undervalued. Although ancient DNA offers a tool to complement traditional knowledge and address gaps in oral history, longstanding disregard for Indigenous sovereignty and beliefs has understandably led many Indigenous communities to distrust DNA studies<sup>1-4</sup>. Earlier research often focused on repatriation claims<sup>5-7</sup>, whereas more recent work has increasingly moved towards enhancing Tribal histories<sup>8,9</sup>. Here we present a collaborative study initiated by a federally recognized Native American tribe, the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico, USA, to address gaps in traditional knowledge and further their understanding of their population history and ancestry. We generated genomes from 16 ancient Picuris individuals and 13 present-day members of Picuris Pueblo, providing genomic data spanning the last millennium. We show genetic continuity between ancient and present-day Picuris, and more broadly with Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon<sup>10</sup>, 275 km to the west. This suggests a firm spatiotemporal link among these Puebloan populations of the North American Southwest. Furthermore, we see no evidence of population decline before European arrival<sup>11-13</sup>, and no Athabascan ancestry in individuals predating 1500 CE, challenging earlier migration hypotheses<sup>14-16</sup>. This work prioritizes Indigenous control of genetic data and brings together oral tradition, archaeology, ethnography and genetics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08791-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Selective inhibition of stromal mechanosensing suppresses cardiac fibrosis.,"Matrix-derived biophysical cues are known to regulate the activation of fibroblasts and their subsequent transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts<sup>1-6</sup>, but whether modulation of these signals can suppress fibrosis in intact tissues remains unclear, particularly in the cardiovascular system<sup>7-10</sup>. Here we demonstrate across multiple scales that inhibition of matrix mechanosensing in persistently activated cardiac fibroblasts potentiates-in concert with soluble regulators of the TGFβ pathway-a robust transcriptomic, morphological and metabolic shift towards quiescence. By conducting a meta-analysis of public human and mouse single-cell sequencing datasets, we identify the focal-adhesion-associated tyrosine kinase SRC as a fibroblast-enriched mechanosensor that can be targeted selectively in stromal cells to mimic the effects of matrix softening in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of SRC by saracatinib, coupled with TGFβ suppression, induces synergistic repression of key profibrotic gene programs in fibroblasts, characterized by a marked inhibition of the MRTF-SRF pathway, which is not seen after treatment with either drug alone. Importantly, the dual treatment alleviates contractile dysfunction in fibrotic engineered heart tissues and in a mouse model of heart failure. Our findings point to joint inhibition of SRC-mediated stromal mechanosensing and TGFβ signalling as a potential mechanotherapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular fibrosis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08945-9
Nature,2025-Jun,A MERS-CoV-like mink coronavirus uses ACE2 as an entry receptor.,"Despite accumulating evidence that bat-derived coronaviruses often require intermediate hosts to facilitate transmission to humans<sup>1</sup>, the potential role of fur animals in zoonotic coronavirus spillovers has largely been overlooked<sup>2</sup>. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a previously undescribed mink respiratory coronavirus (MRCoV) from farmed minks with pneumonia. Notably, MRCoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor and can infect mink, bat, monkey and human cells. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses revealed that the MRCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to the same interface on ACE2 receptors as the RBD of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite structural differences. We identify the key determinants on the RBD of MRCoV and ACE2 that confer efficient binding. HKU5-33S, a bat coronavirus closely related to MRCoV, uses ACE2 of the bat Pipistrellus abramus for cell entry and requires only two amino acid substitutions to adapt to mink ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 protease and polymerase inhibitors potently block MRCoV infection, thereby indicating a potential therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of coronavirus receptor dynamics and highlight their zoonotic potential. Given the risks posed by fur farms as reservoirs for emerging pathogens, our study underscores the need for enhanced surveillance to mitigate future coronavirus outbreaks.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09007-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Spatial mapping of transcriptomic plasticity in metastatic pancreatic cancer.,"Patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer often succumb to systemic metastases<sup>1-3</sup>; however, the transcriptomic heterogeneity that underlies therapeutic recalcitrance remains understudied, particularly in a spatial context. Here we construct high-resolution maps of lineage states, clonal architecture and the tumour microenvironment (TME) using spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number variations in primary and metastatic loci in each patient highlight diverse patient-specific evolutionary trajectories and clonal dissemination. We show that multiple tumour lineage states co-exist in each tissue, including concurrent metastatic foci in the same organ. Agnostic to tissue site, lineage states correlate with distinct TME features, such as the spatial proximity of TGFB1-expressing myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) to aggressive 'basal-like' cancer cells, but not to cells in the 'classical' or 'intermediate' states. These findings were validated through orthogonal and cross-species analyses using mouse tissues and patient-derived organoids. Notably, basal-like cancer cells aligned with myCAFs correlate with plasma-cell exclusion from the tumour milieu, and neighbouring cell analyses suggest that CXCR4-CXCL12 signalling is the underlying basis for observed immune exclusion. Collectively, our findings underscore the profound transcriptomic heterogeneity and microenvironmental dynamics that characterize treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08927-x
Nature,2025-Jun,Deciphering disordered regions controlling mRNA decay in high-throughput.,"Intrinsically disordered regions within proteins drive specific molecular functions despite lacking a defined structure<sup>1,2</sup>. Although disordered regions are integral to controlling mRNA stability and translation, the mechanisms underlying these regulatory effects remain unclear<sup>3</sup>. Here we reveal the molecular determinants of this activity using high-throughput functional profiling. Systematic mutagenesis across hundreds of regulatory disordered elements, combined with machine learning, reveals a complex pattern of molecular features important for their activity. The presence and arrangement of aromatic residues strongly predicts the ability of seemingly diverse protein sequences to influence mRNA stability and translation. We further show how many of these regulatory elements exert their effects by engaging core mRNA decay machinery. Our results define molecular features and biochemical pathways that explain how disordered regions control mRNA expression and shed light on broader principles within functional, unstructured proteins.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08919-x
Nature,2025-Jun,Microbial metabolite drives ageing-related clonal haematopoiesis via ALPK1.,"Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) involves the gradual expansion of mutant pre-leukaemic haematopoietic cells, which increases with age and confers a risk for multiple diseases, including leukaemia and immune-related conditions<sup>1</sup>. Although the absolute risk of leukaemic transformation in individuals with CHIP is very low, the strongest predictor of progression is the accumulation of mutant haematopoietic cells<sup>2</sup>. Despite the known associations between CHIP and increased all-cause mortality, our understanding of environmental and regulatory factors that underlie this process during ageing remains rudimentary. Here we show that intestinal alterations, which can occur with age, lead to systemic dissemination of a microbial metabolite that promotes pre-leukaemic cell expansion. Specifically, ADP-D-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose), a biosynthetic bi-product specific to Gram-negative bacteria<sup>3-5</sup>, is uniquely found in the circulation of older individuals and favours the expansion of pre-leukaemic cells. ADP-heptose is also associated with increased inflammation and cardiovascular risk in CHIP. Mechanistically, ADP-heptose binds to its receptor, ALPK1, triggering transcriptional reprogramming and NF-κB activation that endows pre-leukaemic cells with a competitive advantage due to excessive clonal proliferation. Collectively, we identify that the accumulation of ADP-heptose represents a direct link between ageing and expansion of rare pre-leukaemic cells, suggesting that the ADP-heptose-ALPK1 axis is a promising therapeutic target to prevent progression of CHIP to overt leukaemia and immune-related conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08938-8
Nature,2025-Jun,Targeting PIKfyve-driven lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subsists in a nutrient-deregulated microenvironment, making it particularly susceptible to treatments that interfere with cancer metabolism<sup>1,2</sup>. For example, PDAC uses, and is dependent on, high levels of autophagy and other lysosomal processes<sup>3-5</sup>. Although targeting these pathways has shown potential in preclinical studies, progress has been hampered by the difficulty in identifying and characterizing favourable targets for drug development<sup>6</sup>. Here, we characterize PIKfyve, a lipid kinase that is integral to lysosomal functioning<sup>7</sup>, as a targetable vulnerability in PDAC. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we established that PIKfyve is essential to PDAC progression. Furthermore, through comprehensive metabolic analyses, we found that PIKfyve inhibition forces PDAC to upregulate a distinct transcriptional and metabolic program favouring de novo lipid synthesis. In PDAC, the KRAS-MAPK signalling pathway is a primary driver of de novo lipid synthesis. Accordingly, simultaneously targeting PIKfyve and KRAS-MAPK resulted in the elimination of the tumour burden in numerous preclinical human and mouse models. Taken together, these studies indicate that disrupting lipid metabolism through PIKfyve inhibition induces synthetic lethality in conjunction with KRAS-MAPK-directed therapies for PDAC.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08917-z
Nature,2025-Jun,Structural basis of lipid transfer by a bridge-like lipid-transfer protein.,"Bridge-like lipid-transport proteins (BLTPs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that localize to membrane-contact sites and are thought to mediate the bulk transfer of lipids from a donor membrane, typically the endoplasmic reticulum, to an acceptor membrane, such as that of the cell or an organelle<sup>1</sup>. Although BLTPs are fundamentally important for a wide array of cellular functions, their architecture, composition and lipid-transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here we present the subunit composition and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel of which the interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, one of which we have named Spigot and the other of which remains unnamed. Spigot interacts with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids are expected to enter the tunnel, and experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot has a conserved role in BLTP function. Our LPD-3 complex structural data reveal protein-lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3 complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provides a foundation for mechanistic studies of BLTPs.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08918-y
Nature,2025-Jun,Stereoretentive radical cross-coupling.,"Free radicals were first discovered more than 120 years ago by Gomberg<sup>1</sup> and the first radical cross-couplings demonstrated by Kochi in the 1970s (ref. <sup>2</sup>). In contrast to widely used polar cross-coupling chemistry to forge C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-C(sp<sup>2</sup>) bonds (such as Suzuki, Negishi and Kumada), radical cross-coupling is advantageous when applied to the coupling of saturated systems because of the mild conditions used and enhanced chemoselectivity associated with single-electron chemistry. The ability to use ubiquitous carbon-based fragments (such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, amines and olefins) in cross-coupling has greatly simplified access to various complex molecules<sup>3-9</sup>. Apart from these advantages, enantiospecific coupling reactions involving free radicals are unknown and generally believed to be challenging because of their near-instantaneous racemization (picosecond timescale)<sup>10</sup>. As a result, controlling the stereochemical outcome of radical cross-coupling can be achieved only on a case-by-case basis using bespoke chiral ligands<sup>11</sup> or in a diastereoselective fashion guided by nearby stereocentres<sup>12</sup>. Here we show how readily accessible enantioenriched sulfonylhydrazides and low loadings of an inexpensive achiral Ni catalyst can be used to solve this challenge, thereby enabling enantiospecific, stereoretentive radical cross-coupling between enantioenriched alkyl fragments and (hetero)aryl halides without exogenous redox chemistry or chiral ligands. Calculations support the intermediacy of a unique Ni-bound diazene-containing transition state with C-C bond formation driven by loss of N<sub>2</sub>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09011-0
Nature,2025-Jun,Deep Visual Proteomics maps proteotoxicity in a genetic liver disease.,"Protein misfolding diseases, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), pose substantial health challenges, with their cellular progression still poorly understood<sup>1-3</sup>. We use spatial proteomics by mass spectrometry and machine learning to map AATD in human liver tissue. Combining Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) with single-cell analysis<sup>4,5</sup>, we probe intact patient biopsies to resolve molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across fibrosis stages. We achieve proteome depth of up to 4,300 proteins from one-third of a single cell in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This dataset reveals a potentially clinically actionable peroxisomal upregulation that precedes the canonical unfolded protein response. Our single-cell proteomics data show α1-antitrypsin accumulation is largely cell-intrinsic, with minimal stress propagation between hepatocytes. We integrated proteomic data with artificial intelligence-guided image-based phenotyping across several disease stages, revealing a late-stage hepatocyte phenotype characterized by globular protein aggregates and distinct proteomic signatures, notably including elevated TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL) amounts. This phenotype may represent a critical disease progression stage. Our study offers new insights into AATD pathogenesis and introduces a powerful methodology for high-resolution, in situ proteomic analysis of complex tissues. This approach holds potential to unravel molecular mechanisms in various protein misfolding disorders, setting a new standard for understanding disease progression at the single-cell level in human tissue.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08885-4
Nature,2025-Jun,Structure of the ATP-driven methyl-coenzyme M reductase activation complex.,"Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the enzyme responsible for nearly all biologically generated methane<sup>1</sup>. Its active site comprises coenzyme F<sub>430</sub>, a porphyrin-based cofactor with a central nickel ion that is active exclusively in the Ni(I) state<sup>2,3</sup>. How methanogenic archaea perform the reductive activation of F<sub>430</sub> represents a major gap in our understanding of one of the most ancient bioenergetic systems in nature. Here we purified and characterized the MCR activation complex from Methanococcus maripaludis. McrC, a small subunit encoded in the mcr operon, co-purifies with the methanogenic marker proteins Mmp7, Mmp17, Mmp3 and the A2 component. We demonstrated that this complex can activate MCR in vitro in a strictly ATP-dependent manner, enabling the formation of methane. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the MCR activation complex exhibiting different functional states with local resolutions reaching 1.8-2.1 Å. Our data revealed three complex iron-sulfur clusters that formed an electron transfer pathway towards F<sub>430</sub>. Topology and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses indicate that these clusters are similar to the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster, a maturation intermediate of the catalytic cofactor in nitrogenase. Altogether, our findings offer insights into the activation mechanism of MCR and prospects on the early evolution of nitrogenase.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08890-7
Nature,2025-Jun,Perturbing LSD1 and WNT rewires transcription to synergistically induce AML differentiation.,"Impaired differentiation is a hallmark of myeloid malignancies<sup>1,2</sup>. Therapies that enable cells to circumvent the differentiation block, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), are by and large curative in acute promyelocytic leukaemia<sup>3</sup>, but whether 'differentiation therapy' is a generalizable therapeutic approach for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and beyond remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of the histone demethylase LSD1 (LSD1i) and the WNT pathway antagonist GSK3 kinase<sup>4</sup> (GSK3i) robustly promotes therapeutic differentiation of established AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, as well as reducing tumour burden and significantly extending survival in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, this combination promotes differentiation by activating genes in the type I interferon pathway via inducing expression of transcription factors such as IRF7 (LSD1i) and the co-activator β-catenin (GSK3i), and their selective co-occupancy at targets such as STAT1, which is necessary for combination-induced differentiation. Combination treatment also suppresses the canonical, pro-oncogenic WNT pathway and cell cycle genes. Analysis of datasets from patients with AML suggests a correlation between the combination-induced transcription signature and better prognosis, highlighting clinical potential of this strategy. Collectively, this combination strategy rewires transcriptional programs to suppress stemness and to promote differentiation, which may have important therapeutic implications for AML and WNT-driven cancers beyond AML.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08915-1
Nature,2025-Jun,Low overlap of transcription factor DNA binding and regulatory targets.,"DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) modulate transcription and chromatin architecture, acting from regulatory sites in enhancers and promoters of eukaryotic genes<sup>1,2</sup>. How multiple TFs cooperate to regulate individual genes is still unclear. In yeast, most TFs are thought to regulate transcription via binding to upstream activating sequences, which are situated within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the regulated gene<sup>3</sup>. Although this model has been validated for individual TFs and specific genes, it has not been tested in a systematic way. Here we integrated information on the binding and expression targets for the near-complete set of yeast TFs and show that, contrary to expectations, there are few TFs with dedicated activator or repressor roles, and that most TFs have a dual function. Although nearly all protein-coding genes are regulated by one or more TFs, our analysis revealed limited overlap between TF binding and gene regulation. Rapid depletion of many TFs also revealed many regulatory targets that were distant from detectable TF binding sites, suggesting unexpected regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a comprehensive survey of TF functions and offers insights into interactions between the set of TFs expressed in a single cell type and how they contribute to the complex programme of gene regulation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08916-0
Nature,2025-Jun,A pangenome reference of wild and cultivated rice.,"Oryza rufipogon, the wild progenitor of Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa, is an important resource for rice breeding<sup>1</sup>. Here we present a wild-cultivated rice pangenome based on 145 chromosome-level assemblies, comprising 129 genetically diverse O. rufipogon accessions and 16 diverse varieties of O. sativa. This pangenome contains 3.87 Gb of sequences that are absent from the O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare reference genome. We captured alternate assemblies that include heterozygous information missing in the primary assemblies, and identified a total of 69,531 pan-genes, with 28,907 core genes and 13,728 wild-rice-specific genes. We observed a higher abundance and a significantly greater diversity of resistance-gene analogues in wild rice than in cultivars. Our analysis indicates that two cultivated subpopulations, intro-indica and basmati, were generated through gene flows among cultivars in South Asia. We also provide strong evidence to support the theory that the initial domestication of all Asian cultivated rice occurred only once. Furthermore, we captured 855,122 differentiated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 13,853 differentiated presence-absence variations between indica and japonica, which could be traced to the divergence of their respective ancestors and the existence of a larger genetic bottleneck in japonica. This study provides reference resources for enhancing rice breeding, and enriches our understanding of the origins and domestication process of rice.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08883-6
Nature,2025-Jun,The phased pan-genome of tetraploid European potato.,"Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century<sup>1,2</sup>. Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world<sup>3</sup>. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato 'Russet Burbank') using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08843-0
Nature,2025-Jun,Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a<sup>R878H</sup> HSPCs.,"Clonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses<sup>1-4</sup>. Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot<sup>1-3,5-7</sup>. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3a<sup>R878H/+</sup> mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3A<sup>R882H/+</sup>, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration<sup>8</sup>, reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a<sup>R878H/+</sup> HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3a<sup>R878H/+</sup> HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3A<sup>R882H</sup> HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08871-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Mitochondrial metabolism sustains DNMT3A-R882-mutant clonal haematopoiesis.,"Somatic DNMT3A-R882 codon mutations drive the most common form of clonal haematopoiesis (CH) and are associated with increased acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) risk<sup>1,2</sup>. Preventing expansion of DNMT3A-R882-mutant haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) may therefore avert progression to AML. To identify DNMT3A-R882-mutant-specific vulnerabilities, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen on primary mouse Dnmt3a<sup>R882H/+</sup> HSPCs. Among the 640 vulnerability genes identified, many were involved in mitochondrial metabolism, and metabolic flux analysis confirmed enhanced oxidative phosphorylation use in Dnmt3a<sup>R882H/+</sup> versus Dnmt3a<sup>+/+</sup> (WT) HSPCs. We selected citrate/malate transporter Slc25a1 and complex I component Ndufb11, for which pharmacological inhibitors are available, for downstream studies. In vivo administration of SLC25A1 inhibitor CTPI2 and complex I inhibitors IACS-010759 and metformin suppressed post-transplantation clonal expansion of Dnmt3a<sup>R882H/+</sup>, but not WT, long-term haematopoietic stem cells. The effect of metformin was recapitulated using a primary human DNMT3A-R882 CH sample. Notably, analysis of 412,234 UK Biobank participants showed that individuals taking metformin had a markedly lower prevalence of DNMT3A-R882-mutant CH, after controlling for potential confounders including glycated haemoglobin, diabetes and body mass index. Collectively, our data propose modulation of mitochondrial metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for prevention of DNMT3A-R882-mutant AML.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08980-6
Nature,2025-Jun,PRDM16-dependent antigen-presenting cells induce tolerance to gut antigens.,"The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microorganisms with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pT<sub>reg</sub>) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents<sup>1-4</sup>. Although RORγt<sup>+</sup> antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have been shown to programme gut microbiota-specific pT<sub>reg</sub> cells<sup>5-7</sup>, their definition remains incomplete, and the APC responsible for food tolerance has remained unknown. Here we identify an APC subset that is required for differentiation of both food- and microbiota-specific pT<sub>reg</sub> cells and for establishment of oral tolerance. Development and function of these APCs require expression of the transcription factors PRDM16 and RORγt, as well as a unique Rorc(t) cis-regulatory element. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and surface marker analysis establish the pT<sub>reg</sub>-inducing APCs as myeloid in origin, distinct from type 3 innate lymphoid cells, and sharing epigenetic profiles with classical dendritic cells, and designate them PRDM16<sup>+</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> tolerizing dendritic cells (tolDCs). Upon genetic perturbation of tolDCs, we observe a substantial increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 cells in lieu of pT<sub>reg</sub> cells, leading to compromised tolerance in mouse models of asthma and food allergy. Single-cell analyses of freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, as well as multiple specimens of human intestine and tonsil, reveal candidate tolDCs with co-expression of PRDM16 and RORC and an extensive transcriptome shared with tolDCs from mice, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved role across species. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how tolDCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08982-4
Nature,2025-Jun,Multimodal cell maps as a foundation for structural and functional genomics.,"Human cells consist of a complex hierarchy of components, many of which remain unexplored<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we construct a global map of human subcellular architecture through joint measurement of biophysical interactions and immunofluorescence images for over 5,100 proteins in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Self-supervised multimodal data integration resolves 275 molecular assemblies spanning the range of 10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> m, which we validate systematically using whole-cell size-exclusion chromatography and annotate using large language models<sup>3</sup>. We explore key applications in structural biology, yielding structures for 111 heterodimeric complexes and an expanded Rag-Ragulator assembly. The map assigns unexpected functions to 975 proteins, including roles for C18orf21 in RNA processing and DPP9 in interferon signalling, and identifies assemblies with multiple localizations or cell type specificity. It decodes paediatric cancer genomes<sup>4</sup>, identifying 21 recurrently mutated assemblies and implicating 102 validated new cancer proteins.

Nature,2025-Jun,Swinging lever mechanism of myosin directly shown by time-resolved cryo-EM.,"Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin<sup>1</sup>. Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing<sup>2,3</sup>. However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)<sup>4</sup> of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release<sup>5,6</sup>. Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin<sup>7</sup>. These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08876-5
Nature,2025-Jun,Towards conversational diagnostic artificial intelligence.,"At the heart of medicine lies physician-patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust<sup>1,2</sup>. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based<sup>3</sup> simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination<sup>4,5</sup>. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08866-7
Nature,2025-Jun,Towards accurate differential diagnosis with large language models.,"A comprehensive differential diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical care that is often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process<sup>1</sup>. Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar's test: 45.7, P < 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar's test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians' diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients' access to specialist-level expertise.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08869-4
Nature,2025-Jun,Phenotypic complexities of rare heterozygous neurexin-1 deletions.,"Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations-sometimes affecting the same gene-will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions<sup>1</sup>. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1<sup>+/-</sup> deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08864-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Small molecules restore mutant mitochondrial DNA polymerase activity.,"Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits<sup>1</sup>. More than 300 mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists<sup>2</sup>. Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08856-9
Nature,2025-Jun,Human assembloid model of the ascending neural sensory pathway.,"Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system<sup>1,2</sup>. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony. These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08808-3
Nature,2025-Jun,A Nd@C<sub>82</sub>-polymer interface for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.,"An important challenge in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the simultaneous attainment of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high stability. Using polymer interfaces in PSCs can enhance durability by blocking water and oxygen and by suppressing ion interdiffusion, but their electronic shielding poses a challenge for efficient and stable PSCs<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we report a magnetic endohedral metallofullerene Nd@C<sub>82</sub>-polymer coupling layer, which features ultrafast electron extraction and in situ encapsulation, thereby promoting homogeneous electron extraction and suppressing ion interdiffusion. The Nd@C<sub>82</sub>-polymer coupling layer in PSCs exhibited a PCE of 26.78% (certified 26.29%) and 23.08% with an aperture area of 0.08 cm<sup>2</sup> and 16 cm<sup>2</sup> (modules), respectively.

Nature,2025-Jun,Psilocybin's lasting action requires pyramidal cell types and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors.,"Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses<sup>1-4</sup>. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity<sup>5,6</sup>, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells<sup>7-9</sup>. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics' behavioural actions<sup>10</sup>. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin's ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors abolishes psilocybin's effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin's long-term drug action.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08813-6
Nature,2025-Jun,A neural mechanism for learning from delayed postingestive feedback.,"Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic<sup>1-10</sup> and preferences to those that are nutritious<sup>11-13</sup>. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel<sup>14,15</sup>, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08828-z
Nature,2025-Jun,Genome-wide CRISPR screen in human T cells reveals regulators of FOXP3.,"Regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which specifically express the master transcription factor FOXP3, have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis and have the potential to revolutionize cell therapies for autoimmune diseases<sup>1-3</sup>. Although stimulation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-2 can induce FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in vitro (iT<sub>reg</sub> cells), the resulting cells are often unstable and have thus far hampered translational efforts<sup>4-6</sup>. A systematic approach towards understanding the regulatory networks that dictate T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation could lead to more effective iT<sub>reg</sub> cell-based therapies. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to catalogue gene regulatory determinants of FOXP3 induction in primary human T cells and characterized their effects at single-cell resolution using Perturb-icCITE-seq. We identify the RBPJ-NCOR repressor complex as a novel, context-specific negative regulator of FOXP3 expression. RBPJ-targeted knockout enhanced iT<sub>reg</sub> differentiation and function, independent of canonical Notch signalling. Repeated cytokine and T cell receptor signalling stimulation in vitro revealed that RBPJ-deficient iT<sub>reg</sub> cells exhibit increased phenotypic stability compared with control cells through DNA demethylation of the FOXP3 enhancer CNS2, reinforcing FOXP3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of RBPJ potently suppressed FOXP3 induction through direct modulation of FOXP3 histone acetylation by HDAC3. Finally, RBPJ-ablated human iT<sub>reg</sub> cells more effectively suppressed xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease than control iT<sub>reg</sub> cells in a humanized mouse model. Together, our findings reveal novel regulators of FOXP3 and point towards new avenues to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for autoimmune disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08795-5
Nature,2025-Jun,The P-loop NTPase RUVBL2 is a conserved clock component across eukaryotes.,"The eukaryotic circadian clock keeps time by using a transcription-translation feedback loop, which exhibits an architecture that is conserved across a diverse range of organisms, including fungi, plants and animals<sup>1</sup>. Despite their mechanistic similarity, the molecular components of these clocks indicate a lack of common ancestry<sup>2</sup>. Our study reveals that RUVBL2, which is a P-loop NTPase enzyme previously shown to affect circadian phase and amplitude as part of mammalian clock super-complexes, influences the circadian period through its remarkably slow ATPase activity, resembling the well-characterized KaiC-based clock in cyanobacteria. A screen of RUVBL2 variants identified arrhythmic, short-period and long-period mutants that altered circadian locomotor activity rhythms following delivery by adeno-associated virus to the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus. Enzymatic assays showed that wild-type RUVBL2 hydrolyses only around 13 ATP molecules a day, a vastly reduced turnover compared with typical ATPases. Notably, physical interactions between RUVBL2 orthologues and core clock proteins in humans, Drosophila and the fungus Neurospora, along with consistent circadian phenotypes of RUVBL2-mutant orthologues across species, reinforce their clock-related function in eukaryotes. Thus, as well as establishing RUVBL2 as a common core component in eukaryotic clocks, our study supports the idea that slow ATPase activity, initially discovered in cyanobacteria, is a shared feature of eukaryotic clocks.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08797-3
Nature,2025-Jun,Long-term impact and biological recovery in a deep-sea mining track.,"Deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining is in the exploration phase at present with some groups proposing a move towards extraction within years<sup>1</sup>. Management of this industry requires evidence of the long-term effects on deep-sea ecosystems<sup>2</sup>, but the ability of seafloor ecosystems to recover from impacts over decadal scales is poorly understood<sup>3</sup>. Here we show that, four decades after a test mining experiment that removed nodules, the biological impacts in many groups of organisms are persistent, although populations of several organisms, including sediment macrofauna, mobile deposit feeders and even large-sized sessile fauna, have begun to re-establish despite persistent physical changes at the seafloor. We also reveal that areas affected by plumes from this small-scale test have limited detectable residual sedimentation impacts with some biological assemblages similar in abundance compared to control areas after 44 years. Although some aspects of the modern collector design may cause reduced physical impact compared to this test mining experiment, our results show that mining impacts in the abyssal ocean will be persistent over at least decadal timeframes and communities will remain altered in directly disturbed areas, despite some recolonization.

Despite recent observations of superconductivity in nickel oxide-based compounds (the nickelates), evidence of Cooper pairing above 30 K in a system that is isostructural to the cuprates, but without copper, at ambient pressure and without lattice compression has remained elusive<sup>2-5</sup>. Here we report superconductivity with a T<sub>c</sub> approaching 40 K under ambient pressure in d<sup>9-x</sup> hole-doped, late rare earth, infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO<sub>2</sub> thin films with negligible lattice compression, supported by observations of a zero-resistance state at 31 K and the Meissner effect. The material can be synthesized with essentially no Ruddlesden-Popper-type structural defects, exhibiting ultralow resistivity of approximately 0.01 mΩ cm, and with a residual resistivity ratio of up to 10. Our findings demonstrate the potential for achieving high-temperature superconductivity using strongly correlated d-electron metal oxides beyond copper as the building blocks for superconductivity, and offering a promising platform for further exploration and understanding of high-temperature Cooper pairing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08893-4
Nature,2025-Jun,Genomic determinants of antigen expression hierarchy in African trypanosomes.,"Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery<sup>1,2</sup>. A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene-an important trigger for antigen switching-the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08720-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Complex water networks visualized by cryogenic electron microscopy of RNA.,"The stability and function of biomolecules are directly influenced by their myriad interactions with water<sup>1-16</sup>. Here we investigated water through cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on a highly solvated molecule: the Tetrahymena ribozyme. By using segmentation-guided water and ion modelling (SWIM)<sup>17,18</sup>, an approach combining resolvability and chemical parameters, we automatically modelled and cross-validated water molecules and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in the ribozyme core, revealing the extensive involvement of water in mediating RNA non-canonical interactions. Unexpectedly, in regions where SWIM does not model ordered water, we observed highly similar densities in both cryo-EM maps. In many of these regions, the cryo-EM densities superimpose with complex water networks predicted by molecular dynamics, supporting their assignment as water and suggesting a biophysical explanation for their elusiveness to conventional atomic coordinate modelling. Our study demonstrates an approach to unveil both rigid and flexible waters that surround biomolecules through cryo-EM map densities, statistical and chemical metrics, and molecular dynamics simulations.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08855-w
Nature,2025-Jun,Automated loss of pulse detection on a consumer smartwatch.,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a time-sensitive emergency that requires prompt identification and intervention: sudden, unwitnessed cardiac arrest is nearly unsurvivable<sup>1-3</sup>. A cardinal sign of cardiac arrest is sudden loss of pulse<sup>4</sup>. Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the substantial prognostic role of time<sup>3,5</sup>, but only if the false-positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized<sup>5-7</sup>. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at a societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography, we show that wearable photoplethysmography measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced through an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation. On the basis of the similarity of the photoplethysmography signal (from ventricular fibrillation or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Following its development, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval of 64.32% to 70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model. These results indicate an opportunity, deployable at scale, for wearable-based detection of sudden loss of pulse while minimizing societal costs of excess false detections<sup>7</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08810-9
