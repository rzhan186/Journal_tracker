J Hazard Mater,2024-Aug-05,Peroxidase in plant defense: Novel insights for cadmium accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis plays crucial roles in the adaptation to cadmium (Cd) stress. Nevertheless, few reports have dabbled in physiological mechanisms of such super pathway regulating Cd accumulation in plants. Herein, by integrating transcriptomic, histological and molecular biology approaches, the present study dedicated to clarify molecular mechanism on how rice adapt to Cd stress via phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Our analysis identified that the enhancement of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was as a key response to Cd stress. Intriguingly, POD occupied a significant part in this process, with the number of POD related genes accounted for 26/29 of all upregulated genes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. We further used SHAM (salicylhydroxamic acid, the POD inhibitor) to validate that POD exhibited a negative correlation with the Cd accumulation in rice tissues, and proposed two intrinsic molecular mechanisms on POD in contributing to Cd detoxification. One strategy was that POD promoted the formation of lignin and CSs both in endodermis and exodermis for intercepting Cd influx. In detail, inhibited POD induced by external addition of SHAM decreased the content of lignin by 50.98-66.65 % and delayed percentage of the D<sub>TIP-CS</sub> to root length by 39.17-104.51 %. The other strategy was expression of transporter genes involved in Cd uptake, including OsIRT1, OsIRT2, OsZIP1 and OsZIP, negatively regulated by POD. In a word, our findings firstly draws a direct link between POD activity and the Cd accumulation, which is imperative for the breeding of rice with low-Cd-accumulating capacity in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134826
J Hazard Mater,2024-Aug-05,Inhibition mechanism of Rhizoctonia solani by pectin-coated iron metal-organic framework nanoparticles and evidence of an induced defense response in rice.,"Nanocrop protectants have attracted much attention as sustainable platforms for controlling pests and diseases and improving crop nutrition. Here, we reported the fungicidal activity and disease inhibition potential of pectin-coated metal-iron organic framework nanoparticles (Fe-MOF-PT NPs) against rice stripe blight (RSB). An in vitro bacterial inhibition assay showed that Fe-MOF-PT NPs (80 mg/L) significantly inhibited mycelial growth and nucleus formation. The Fe-MOF-PT NPs adsorbed to the surface of mycelia and induced toxicity by disrupting cell membranes, mitochondria, and DNA. The results of a nontargeted metabolomics analysis showed that the metabolites of amino acids and their metabolites, heterocyclic compounds, fatty acids, and nucleotides and their metabolites were significantly downregulated after treatment with 80 mg/L NPs. The difference in metabolite abundance between the CK and Fe-MOF-PT NPs (80 mg/L) treatment groups was mainly related to nucleotide metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. The results of the greenhouse experiment showed that Fe-MOF-PT NPs improved rice resistance to R. solani by inhibiting mycelial invasion, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities, activating the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, and enhancing photosynthesis. These findings indicate the great potential of Fe-MOF-PT NPs as a new RSB disease management strategy and provide new insights into plant fungal disease management.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134807
J Hazard Mater,2024-Aug-05,"Co-contamination and interactions of multiple mycotoxins and heavy metals in rice, maize, soybeans, and wheat flour marketed in Shanghai City.","Mycotoxins and heavy metals extensively contaminate grains and grain products, posing severe health risks. This work implements validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods to quantify the concentration of 12 mycotoxins and five heavy metals in rice, maize, soybeans, and wheat flour samples marketed in Shanghai. The mixed contamination characteristics were analyzed using correlation cluster analysis and co-contamination index, and the probabilities of all cross combinations of contaminations were analyzed using a self-designed JAVA language program. The results showed that grains and grain products were frequently contaminated with both mycotoxins and heavy metals, mostly with deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON), ochratoxin A (OTA), aflatoxins, fumonisin B1 (FB1), fumonisin B2 (FB2), fumonisin B3 (FB3), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) and cadmium (Cd). All the samples (100 %) were contaminated with two or more contaminants, and 77.3 % of the samples were co-contaminated with more than four contaminants. In cereals and cereal products, the following combinations were closely associated: (FB3 +3-ADON), (FB1 +As), (FB1 +FB2), (DON+FB1), (DON+Cd), (As+Cd), (DON+Cd+As), (FB1 +FB2 +As), and (DON+3-ADON+15-ADON). The results indicated that mycotoxins and heavy metals frequently co-occurred in Shanghai grains and grain products, and they provided primary data for safety assessments, early warnings, and regulatory measures on these contaminants to protect public health.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134695
J Hazard Mater,2024-Aug-05,Multiomics analysis reveals a substantial decrease in nanoplastics uptake and associated impacts by nano zinc oxide in fragrant rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Nanoplastics (NPs) have emerged as global environmental pollutants with concerning implications for sustainable agriculture. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of NPs toxicity and devising strategies to mitigate their impact is crucial for crop growth and development. Here, we investigated the nanoparticles of zinc oxide (nZnO) to mitigate the adverse effects of 80 nm NPs on fragrant rice. Our results showed that optimized nZnO (25 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) concentration rescued root length and structural deficits by improving oxidative stress response, antioxidant defense mechanism and balanced nutrient levels, compared to seedlings subjected only to NPs stress (50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). Consequently, microscopy observations, Zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results revealed that NPs were mainly accumulated on the initiation joints of secondary roots and between cortical cells that blocks the nutrients uptake, while the supplementation of nZnO led to the formation of aggregates with NPs, which effectively impedes the uptake of NPs by the roots of fragrant rice. Transcriptomic analysis identified a total of 3973, 3513 and 3380 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to NPs, nZnO and NPs+nZnO, respectively, compared to the control. Moreover, DEGs were significantly enriched in multiple pathways including biosynthesis of secondary metabolite, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions, MAPK signaling pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. These pathways could play a significant role in alleviating NPs toxicity and restoring fragrant rice roots. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis demonstrated that nZnO application restored 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) pathways genes expression, enzymatic activities, and the content of essential precursors related to 2-AP biosynthesis under NPs toxicity, which ultimately led to the restoration of 2-AP content in the leaves. In conclusion, this study shows that optimized nZnO application effectively alleviates NPs toxic effects and restores both root structure and aroma production in fragrant rice leaves. This research offers a sustainable and practical strategy to enhance crop production under NPs toxicity while emphasizing the pivotal role of essential micronutrient nanomaterials in agriculture.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134640
J Hazard Mater,2024-Aug-05,Computerized analysis of haptens for the ultrasensitive and specific detection of Pyriftalid.,"Pyriftalid (Pyr) is one of the most commonly used herbicides and due to its widespread and improper use, it has led to serious pollution of groundwater, soil and other ecosystems, threatening human health. A rapid method to detect Pyr was urgently needed. A high specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against Pyr with IC50 values of 4.7 ng/mL was obtained by mAb screening technique and method with enhanced matrix effect. The study firstly proposed colloidal gold immunochromatographic test strips (CGIA) for Pyr, which enables rapid qualitative and quantitative determination of a large number of samples anytime and anywhere, so as to effectively monitor Pyr in environment and grain samples. Based on the properties of the desired Pyr antibody, the hapten Pyr-hapten-4 with high structural similarity to Pyr molecule, similar electrostatic potential distribution, and the ability to expose Pyr functional groups was screened out from five different Pyr haptens, which was consistent with mouse antiserum test. The CGIA quickly analyze the Pyr content in positive samples such as water samples, soil samples, paddy samples, brown rice samples within 10 min, the LOD for Pyr by CGIA as low as 1.84 ng/g, the v LOD value as low as 6 ng/g, and the extinction value as low as 25 ng/g. The content of positive samples detected by CGIA was consistent with the quantitative results of LC-MS/MS, the relative accuracy was within the range of 97-103 %. The recovery rate range for Pyr by CGIA was 92.0-99.7 %, and the coefficient of variation was between 1.30-8.56 %. It indicated Pyr-targeted CGIA test strip was an efficient and fast detection method to detect real environment and food samples.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134705
J Hazard Mater,2024-Jul-15,The role of OsBZR4 as a brassinosteroid-signaling component in mediating atrazine and isoproturon degradation in rice.,"Development of a biotechnological system for rapid degradation of pesticides is important to mitigate the environmental, food security, and health risks that they pose. Degradation of atrazine (ATZ) and isoproturon (IPU) in rice crops promoted by the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling component BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT4 (OsBZR4) is explored. OsBZR4 is localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus, and is strongly induced by ATZ and IPU exposure. Transgenic rice OsBZR4-overexpression (OE) significantly enhances resistance to ATZ and IPU toxicity, improving growth, and reducing ATZ and IPU accumulation (particularly in grains) in rice crops. Genetic destruction of OsBZR4 (CRISPR/Cas9) increases rice sensitivity and leads to increased accumulation of ATZ and IPU. OE plants promote phase I, II, and III metabolic reactions, and expression of corresponding pesticide degradation genes under ATZ and IPU stress. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis reveals increased relative contents of ATZ and IPU metabolites and conjugates in OE plants, suggesting an increased OsBZR4 expression and consequent detoxification of ATZ and IPU in rice and the environment. The role of OsBZR4 in pesticide degradation is revealed, and its potential application in enhancing plant resistance to pesticides, and facilitating the breakdown of pesticides in rice and the environment, is discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134625
J Hazard Mater,2024-Jun-05,A meta-analysis on crop growth and heavy metals accumulation with PGPB inoculation in contaminated soils.,"Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) offer a promising solution for mitigating heavy metals (HMs) stress in crops, yet the mechanisms underlying the way they operate in the soil-plant system are not fully understood. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis with 2037 observations to quantitatively evaluate the effects and determinants of PGPB inoculation on crop growth and HMs accumulation in contaminated soils. We found that inoculation increased shoot and root biomass of all five crops (rice, maize, wheat, soybean, and sorghum) and decreased metal accumulation in rice and wheat shoots together with wheat roots. Key factors driving inoculation efficiency included soil organic matter (SOM) and the addition of exogenous fertilizers (N, P, and K). The phylum Proteobacteria was identified as the keystone taxa in effectively alleviating HMs stress in crops. More antioxidant enzyme activity, photosynthetic pigment, and nutrient absorption were induced by it. Overall, using PGPB inoculation improved the growth performance of all five crops, significantly increasing crop biomass in shoots, roots, and grains by 33 %, 35 %, and 20 %, respectively, while concurrently significantly decreasing heavy metal accumulation by 16 %, 9 %, and 37 %, respectively. These results are vital to grasping the benefits of PGPB and its future application in enhancing crop resistance to HMs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134370
J Hazard Mater,2024-Jun-05,Effect of aqueous phase from hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge on heavy metals and heavy metal resistance genes during chicken manure composting.,"Livestock manure is often contaminated with heavy metals (HMs) and HM resistance genes (HMRGs), which pollute the environment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the aqueous phase (AP) produced by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of sewage sludge (SS) alone and the AP produced by co-HTC of rice husk (RH) and SS (RH-SS) on humification, HM bioavailability, and HMRGs during chicken manure composting. RH-SS and SS increased the humic acid content of the compost products by 18.3 % and 9.7 %, respectively, and significantly increased the humification index (P < 0.05) compared to the CK (addition of tap water). The passivation of HMs (Zn, Cu, As, Pb, and Cr) increased by 12.17-23.36 % and 9.74-15.95 % for RH-SS and SS, respectively, compared with that for CK. RH-SS and SS reduced the HMRG abundance in composted products by 22.29 % and 15.07 %, respectively. The partial least squares path modeling results showed that SS and RH-SS promoted compost humification while simultaneously altering the bacterial community and reducing the bioavailability of metals and host abundance of HMRGs, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the production and distribution of HMRGs. These findings support a new strategy to reduce the environmental risk of HMs and HMRGs in livestock manure utilization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134398
J Hazard Mater,2024-Jun-05,Targeting OsNIP3;1 via CRISPR/Cas9: A strategy for minimizing arsenic accumulation and boosting rice resilience.,"Arsenic (As) contamination in rice poses a significant threat to human health due to its toxicity and widespread consumption. Identifying and manipulating key genes governing As accumulation in rice is crucial for reducing this threat. The large NIP gene family of aquaporins in rice presents a promising target due to functional redundancy, potentially allowing for gene manipulation without compromising plant growth. This study aimed to utilize genome editing to generate knock-out (KO) lines of genes of NIP family (OsLsi1, OsNIP3;1) and an anion transporter family (OsLsi2), in order to assess their impact on As accumulation and stress tolerance in rice. KO lines were created using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and the As accumulation patterns, physiological performance, and grain yield were compared against wild-type (WT) under As-treated conditions. KO lines exhibited significantly reduced As accumulation in grain compared to WT. Notably, Osnip3;1 KO line displayed reduced As in xylem sap (71-74%) and grain (32-46%) upon treatment. Additionally, these lines demonstrated improved silicon (23%) uptake, photosynthetic pigment concentrations (Chl a: 77%; Chl b: 79%, Total Chl: 79% & Carotenoid: 49%) overall physiological and agronomical performance under As stress compared to WT. This study successfully utilized genome editing for the first time to identify OsNIP3;1 as a potential target for manipulating As accumulation in rice without compromising grain yield or plant vigor.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134325
J Hazard Mater,2024-May-15,"Biosynthetic selenium nanoparticles (Bio-SeNPs) mitigate the toxicity of antimony (Sb) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by limiting Sb uptake, improving antioxidant defense system and regulating stress-related gene expression.","Nanotechnology offers a promising and innovative approach to mitigate biotic and abiotic stress in crop production. In this study, the beneficial role and potential detoxification mechanism of biogenic selenium nanoparticles (Bio-SeNPs) prepared from Psidium guajava extracts in alleviating antimony (Sb) toxicity in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) were investigated. The results revealed that exogenous addition of Bio-SeNPs (0.05 g/L) into the hydroponic-cultured system led to a substantial enhancement in rice shoot height (73.3%), shoot fresh weight (38.7%) and dry weight (28.8%) under 50 μM Sb(III) stress conditions. Compared to Sb exposure alone, hydroponic application of Bio-SeNPs also greatly promoted rice photosynthesis, improved cell viability and membrane integrity, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and increased antioxidant activities. Meanwhile, exogenous Bio-SeNPs application significantly lowered the Sb accumulation in rice roots (77.1%) and shoots (35.1%), and reduced its root to shoot translocation (55.3%). Additionally, Bio-SeNPs addition were found to modulate the subcellular distribution of Sb and the expression of genes associated with Sb detoxification in rice, such as OsCuZnSOD2, OsCATA, OsGSH1, OsABCC1, and OsWAK11. Overall, our findings highlight the great potential of Bio-SeNPs as a promising alternative for reducing Sb accumulation in crop plants and boosting crop production under Sb stress conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134263
J Hazard Mater,2024-May-15,"A novel aldo-keto reductase gene, OsAKR1, from rice confers higher tolerance to cadmium stress in rice by an in vivo reactive aldehyde detoxification.","Elevated levels of cadmium (Cd) have the ability to impede plant development. Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) have been demonstrated in a number of plant species to improve tolerance to a variety of abiotic stresses by scavenging cytotoxic aldehydes; however, only a few AKRs have been identified to improve Cd tolerance. The OsAKR1 gene was extracted and identified from rice here. After being exposed to Cd, the expression of OsAKR1 dramatically rose in both roots and shoots, although more pronounced in roots. According to a subcellular localization experiment, the nucleus and cytoplasm are where OsAKR1 is primarily found. Mutants lacking OsAKR1 exhibited Cd sensitive phenotype than that of the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare (Nip), and osakr1 mutants exhibited reduced capacity to scavenge methylglyoxal (MG). Furthermore, osakr1 mutants exhibited considerably greater hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increased catalase (CAT) activity in comparison to Nip. The expression of three isomeric forms of CAT was found to be considerably elevated in osakr1 mutants during Cd stress, as demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, when compared to Nip. These results imply that OsAKR1 controlled rice's ability to withstand Cd by scavenging harmful aldehydes and turning on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging mechanism.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134212
J Hazard Mater,2024-May-15,Cadmium biosorption and mechanism investigation using two cadmium-tolerant microorganisms isolated from rhizosphere soil of rice.,"Microbial remediation of cadmium-contaminated soil offers advantages like environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and simple operation. However, the efficacy of this remediation process relies on obtaining dominant strains and a comprehensive understanding of their Cd adsorption mechanisms. This study identified two Cd-resistant bacteria, Burkholderia sp. 1-22 and Bacillus sp. 6-6, with significant growth-promoting effects from rice rhizosphere soil. The strains showed remarkable Cd resistance up to ∼200 mg/L and alleviated Cd toxicity by regulating pH and facilitating bacterial adsorption of Cd. FTIR analysis showed crucial surface functional groups, like carboxyl and amino groups, on bacteria played significant roles in Cd adsorption. The strains could induce CdCO<sub>3</sub> formation via a microbially induced calcium precipitation (MICP) mechanism, confirmed by SEM-EDS, X-ray analysis, and elemental mapping. Pot experiments showed these strains significantly increased organic matter and enzyme activity (e.g., urease, sucrase, peroxidase) in the rhizosphere soil versus the control group. These changes are crucial for restricting Cd mobility. Furthermore, strains 6-6 and 1-22 significantly enhance plant root detoxification of Cd, alleviating toxicity. Notably, increased pH likely plays a vital role in enhancing Cd precipitation and adsorption by strains, converting free Cd into non-bioavailable forms.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134134
