Nature,2025-Apr,Topological segregation of stress sensors along the gut crypt-villus axis.,"The crypt-villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part<sup>1,2</sup>. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut<sup>3-6</sup>. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08581-9
Nature,2025-Apr,Global engineering effects of soil invertebrates on ecosystem functions.,"The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems<sup>1,2</sup>. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates<sup>3</sup> at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08594-y
Nature,2025-Apr,Learning produces an orthogonalized state machine in the hippocampus.,"Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning and behaviour. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus<sup>1</sup>, but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, 'state cells'). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08548-w
Nature,2025-Apr,Macrophages protect against sensory axon loss in peripheral neuropathy.,"Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity<sup>1</sup>, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain<sup>2,3</sup>. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia<sup>4</sup>, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages<sup>5</sup> and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes<sup>6</sup>, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08535-1
Nature,2025-Apr,σ-Bond insertion reactions of two strained diradicaloids.,"The development of new synthetic methodologies is instrumental for enabling the discovery of new medicines. The methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (that is, saturated arene bioisosteres) have become highly coveted<sup>1-4</sup>. The incorporation of these bioisosteres typically leads to favourable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here we report a new synthetic method that furnishes a coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold<sup>5,6</sup>, using mild reaction conditions and an operationally simple protocol. The methodology proceeds through the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of about 30 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> (ref. <sup>7</sup>) and about 60 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> (ref. <sup>6</sup>), respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed by a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character<sup>8</sup>, an underused parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08745-1
Nature,2025-Apr,Observation of plastic ice VII by quasi-elastic neutron scattering.,"Water is the third most abundant molecule in the universe and a key component in the interiors of icy moons, giant planets and Uranus- and Neptune-like exoplanets<sup>1-3</sup>. Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases<sup>4-6</sup>. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII (ref. <sup>4</sup>), and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase<sup>7-12</sup> in which individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body-centred cubic structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules showing picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather shows rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals<sup>13,14</sup>. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will affect our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08750-4
Nature,2025-Mar,Intrinsic electrical activity drives small-cell lung cancer progression.,"Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types<sup>1,2</sup>; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness<sup>3</sup>. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte-neuron metabolite shuttle<sup>6</sup>. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08575-7
Nature,2025-Mar,A metagenomic 'dark matter' enzyme catalyses oxidative cellulose conversion.,"The breakdown of cellulose is one of the most important reactions in nature<sup>1,2</sup> and is central to biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals<sup>3</sup>. However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion<sup>4</sup>. Here, by mining the metagenomic 'dark matter' (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance<sup>5-7</sup>. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08553-z
Nature,2025-Mar,Transcriptional adaptation upregulates utrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein<sup>1,2</sup>. Utrophin (UTRN), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD, is upregulated in some DMD patients<sup>3-5</sup>. To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD<sup>PTC</sup> minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD, aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD<sup>ΔE52</sup> patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation<sup>6-8</sup> plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD<sup>PTC</sup> patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08539-x
Nature,2025-Mar,Global biodiversity loss from outsourced deforestation.,"Globalization increasingly allows countries to externalize the environmental costs of land use, including biodiversity loss<sup>1</sup>. So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries<sup>2</sup>. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08569-5
Nature,2025-Mar,Measuring racial educational disparities over time amongst top achievers.,"Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind<sup>1</sup>. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we focus on the 'racial excellence gap'-the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves<sup>4,5</sup>. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8-9) to high school (typically ages 14-18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student's socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality<sup>6</sup> had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the 'racial glass ceiling'.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08536-0
Nature,2025-Mar,A crucial role for the cortical amygdala in shaping social encounters.,"Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable resources. In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling<sup>1</sup>. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)-an extended olfactory structure-was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COApl<sup>Esr1</sup>) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COApl<sup>Esr1</sup> cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COApl<sup>Esr1</sup> projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COApl<sup>Esr1</sup> cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08540-4
Nature,2025-Mar,Converging mechanism of UM171 and KBTBD4 neomorphic cancer mutations.,"Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein-protein interactions to drive aberrant function<sup>1,2</sup>. As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma<sup>3</sup>, the most common embryonal brain tumour in children<sup>4</sup>. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST<sup>5</sup>. However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3-neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4-HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein-protein interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08533-3
Nature,2025-Mar,UM171 glues asymmetric CRL3-HDAC1/2 assembly to degrade CoREST corepressors.,"UM171 is a potent agonist of ex vivo human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal<sup>1</sup>. By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1-CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition<sup>2,3</sup>. However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3-neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST-HDAC1/2-KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1. By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08532-4
Nature,2025-Mar,Balanced plant helper NLR activation by a modified host protein complex.,"Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors<sup>1</sup>. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers<sup>2,3</sup>, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)<sup>4</sup>. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1-SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1-SAG101-NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1-SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1-SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1-SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1-SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08521-7
Nature,2025-Mar,Activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR.,"Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity<sup>1</sup>. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. <sup>2,3</sup>). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane<sup>4,5</sup>. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1-AtSAG101-AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E<sup>5,6</sup>. We report structures of AtEDS1-AtSAG101-AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1-AtSAG101-AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1-AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1-AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1-AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08517-3
Nature,2025-Mar,"Genetic architecture in Greenland is shaped by demography, structure and selection.","Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research<sup>1,2</sup>, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08516-4
