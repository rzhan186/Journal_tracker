Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-28,Contrasting Responses of Smoke Dispersion and Fire Emissions to Aerosol-Radiation Interaction during the Largest Australian Wildfires in 2019-2020.,"The record-breaking 2019-2020 Australian wildfires have been primarily linked to climate change and its internal variability. However, the meteorological feedback mechanisms affecting smoke dispersion and wildfire emissions on a synoptic scale remain unclear. This study focused on the largest wildfires occurring between December 25, 2019 and January 10, 2020, under the enhanced subtropical high, when the double peak in wildfire evolution was favored by sustained low humidity and two synchronous increases in temperature and wind. Based on the coupled atmospheric chemical transport model, we revealed an abnormal downdraft and a lowered planetary boundary layer over southeastern Australia, caused by the radiative cooling effects (exceeding -100 W m<sup>-2</sup> at surface) of carbonaceous aerosols (CAs) from wildfires. These changes hindered the smoke dispersion and increased the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration by ∼27.8%. By contrast, the low-level anomalous cyclonic circulation induced by CAs brought more water vapor toward the fire zone. This, combined with surface cooling and low wind speeds, suppressed wildfire emissions, thereby reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration by ∼11.6%. These findings highlight the critical role of aerosol-radiation interaction in wildfire behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c12034
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Deriving Membrane-Water and Protein-Water Partition Coefficients from In Vitro Experiments for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS).,"The phospholipid membrane-water partition coefficients (<i>K</i><sub>MW</sub>) and equilibrium binding affinities for human serum albumin (HSA) of 60 structurally diverse perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were evaluated through laboratory measurements and modeling to enhance our understanding of PFAS distribution in organisms. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids exhibited a 0.36 ± 0.01 log-unit increase in <i>K</i><sub>MW</sub> as the fluorinated carbon chain length increased from C<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>16</sub>, while per- and polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates showed a 0.37 ± 0.02 log-unit increase. The highest HSA affinity range was observed between C<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>10</sub>, with the following structural subclass order: per- and polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates ≈ ether sulfonic acids > polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids > fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids > phosphate diesters ≈ per- and polyfluoroether carboxylic acids. A comparison between association rate constants (K<sub>A</sub>) and HSA-PFAS molecular docking predictions with AutoDock Vina indicated that modeling could effectively predict the affinity of PFAS to HSA, especially for PFAS carbon chain lengths from C<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>10</sub>. Based on in vitro results, exposure-dependent PFAS partitioning in organisms was modeled by comparing distribution coefficients between PFAS in phospholipid membranes and HSA at different PFAS concentrations and demonstrated that at lower concentrations, PFAS had higher partitioning in HSA, while with increasing concentration, the proportion of binding relative to the aqueous phase shifted toward the phospholipid membrane. Few studies have compared the bioaccumulation of PFAS in phospholipid membranes and HSA. This research reports that protein-water distribution coefficients are higher than membrane-water partitioning coefficients at lower PFAS concentrations, which may have implications for interpreting exposure data and toxicity experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c06734
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Short-Chain Chlorinated Paraffins May Induce Ovarian Damage in Mice via AIM2- and NLRP12-PANoptosome.,"Humans may intake 0.02 mg/kg/day of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), and no study is available on mammalian ovarian damage caused by low-level SCCPs. In this study, four groups of 5-week-old female Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were orally administered 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg/day SCCPs for 21 consecutive days, and serum and ovaries were collected 20 h after the last SCCPs-administration. SCCPs at ≥0.1 mg/kg/day were found to reduce follicle counts at each stage, induce dose-dependent oxidative stress in mice, and lower serum E2 and ovarian anti-Müllerian hormone levels. The data indicated that cellular PANoptosis increased in the ovaries of all SCCP-treated mice. Furthermore, AIM2- and NLRP12-PANoptosome gene and protein levels were considerably elevated. Female germline stem cells (FGSCs) in the cortical portion of the ovary exhibited substantial damage in all SCCP groups, additionally, the expression of FGSC marker genes and major marker proteins was diminished in the ovaries. Oral administration of SCCPs with 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg/day to mice resulted in PANoptosis of the ovaries. Therefore, it was suggested that the oral administration of ≥0.1 mg/kg/day of SCCPs suppressed ovarian function, which may be attributed to the fact that SCCPs induced the generation of AIM2- and NLRP12-PANoptosome in ovary cells.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08622
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Hexafluoropropylene Oxide Trimer Acid Is an Unsafe Substitute to Perfluorooctanoic Acid Due to Its Remarkable Liver Accumulation in Mice Disclosed by Comprehensive Toxicokinetic Models.,"Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>(CF<sub>2</sub>OCF(CF<sub>3</sub>))<sub>2</sub>COOH) is widely used as an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but whether it is a safe alternative requires further evaluation. In this study, male mice were exposed to three dosages (0.56, 2.8, and 14 mg/kg) of HFPO-TA via single oral gavage or intravenous injection for 28 days. HFPO-TA was rapidly absorbed into the blood and tissues within 15 min postexposure, with a volume of distribution approximately 3 times higher than PFOA, indicating a greater propensity for tissue distribution. Notably, HFPO-TA was distinctly more accumulated in liver compared to plasma and other tissues and very poorly excreted, with only 2.23% in urine and 7.26% in feces on the 21st day after oral exposure. A physiologically based toxicokinetic model, extrapolated to long-term low-dose exposure, revealed a lower bile clearance rate (8-fold) and higher liver partition coefficient (7-fold) than PFOA, and a higher hepatic first-pass effect of HFPO-TA (5-fold) than PFOA, contributing to its remarkable liver accumulation (5-fold). Molecular docking analysis reveals strong binding affinity of HFPO-TA with typical enterohepatic circulation transport proteins due to its strong hydrophobicity, flexible chain structure, and formation of additional hydrogen bonds, favoring HFPO-TA accumulation in the liver. The results suggest that HFPO-TA may not be a safe substitute for legacy PFAS, and further human exposure risk assessments are warranted.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c10349
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,"Evaluation of Bayesian Maximum Entropy Data Fusion Approaches to Estimate Styrene, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes and to Inform Epidemiological Analyses in the US Gulf States.","The Gulf States are home to industries emitting styrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (SBTEX). Presently, adverse health effects of ambient SBTEX exposure in highly polluted regions, such as the Gulf States, must be evaluated. Epidemiologists, however, are limited by inadequate estimates of ambient SBTEX. Using Bayesian Maximum Entropy, SBTEX estimation methods of varying resource intensity were evaluated, including simple kriging (least intense), incorporation of observational and emissions data trends (moderately intense), and data fusion of observed and Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions (CAMx) data (most intense). Generally, as resource intensity increased, so did SBTEX estimation performance, where SBTEX Spearman <i>R</i> values increased by 0.48 on average from the least to most intense methods. Data fusion of observed and CAMx data was identified as the best ambient SBTEX estimation method in the Gulf States. Exposure estimates revealed that Gulf States residences within commuting distance of high industrial activity experienced 1.64 times higher 97.5th percentile daily exposures to SBTEX on average than those living in less industrialized areas, which could contribute to total occupational and ambient exposure disparities. Furthermore, ambient benzene exposure was greater than the acceptable one-in-a-million excess cancer risk threshold for 75% of estimated residence locations in the Gulf States.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c05094
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Acute and Subchronic Toxicity of 6PPD-Quinone to Early Life Stage Lake Trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>).,"<i>N</i>-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-<i>N</i>'-phenyl-<i>p</i>-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD-Q) is a rubber-tire derivative which leaches into surface waters from roadway runoff, from tire particles and has been identified as a possible driver of urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon. Sensitivity to this toxicant is highly variable across fish species and life stages. With environmental concentrations meeting or exceeding toxicity thresholds in sensitive fishes, the potential for ecologically relevant effects is significant. There is currently no data regarding the sensitivity of lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) to 6PPD-Q. As early life stages of fishes are typically more sensitive than adults, the goal of this study was to evaluate the acute and subchronic toxicity of 6PPD-Q to early life stage lake trout. Alevins exposed from hatch until 45 days posthatch (dph) to time-weighted average 6PPD-Q concentrations ranging from 0.22 to 13.5 μg/L exhibited a 45 day median lethal dose (LC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.39 μg/L. Deformities throughout growth were observed, with a unique pooling of blood observed in the caudal fin and eye. A subsequent acute study with exogenously feeding lake trout fry determined a 96 h LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.50 μg/L. From this study we can conclude that lake trout alevins and exogenously feeding fry are sensitive to 6PPD-Q, which underscores the relevance of this chemical to inland freshwater ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c09090
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Potential Air Quality Side-Effects of Emitting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to Enhance Methane Oxidation as a Climate Solution.,"Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 81.2 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The intentional emission of oxidants into the atmosphere has been proposed as a geoengineering solution to accelerate the oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub>, thereby reducing surface warming. However, there has been little consideration for competing atmospheric oxidation pathways that will reduce CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation efficiencies and result in the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter. Using a global chemical-transport model, we simulate a proposed technology to intentionally emit H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere to elevate OH concentrations and enhance CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. We find that proposed emission rates of oxidants have minimal impacts on monthly average tropospheric ozone and particulate matter concentrations. However, competition for the oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> would necessitate widespread adoption of such technology to remove substantial concentrations of atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>, which would in-turn cause considerable increases in regional winter-time particulate matter. Our work underscores the need to consider competing chemistry in evaluating the efficacy and side effects of proposals to enhance the atmospheric oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> as a climate solution.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c11697
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Real-World Particle Emissions from a Modern Heavy-Duty Diesel Vehicle during Normal Operation and DPF Regeneration Events: Impacts on Disadvantaged Communities.,"We assessed the real-world particulate emissions of a goods movement diesel vehicle, with an emphasis on total particle number and solid particle number emissions at different cutoff sizes. The vehicle was tested on routes in the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) of California, representative of typical goods movement operation between the ports to warehouses and logistic centers with a mixture of urban and highway driving, as well as elevation change. We evaluated emissions during normal vehicle operation and diesel particulate filter (DPF) active regeneration events. Results revealed small variations in particle emissions between the routes, with particles below 23 nm and even 10 nm being abundant in the exhaust. Both total and solid particle number emissions were about 3 to 246 times higher during DPF regeneration compared to normal vehicle operation, with higher fractions of sub-10 nm solid particles. We showed that typical daily routes for goods movement operation in SCAB, especially the more urban routes, mostly occurred within disadvantaged communities, with minority populations and high indices for poverty, unemployment, and poor education. Our results indicated the vehicles spent a higher fraction of their total time within these areas at low speed and idling conditions, resulting in disproportionately higher exposures to ultrafine particles.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c12448
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Visualization of Syntrophic Benzene-Fermenting <i>Desulfobacterota</i> ORM2 in a Methanogenic Enrichment Culture Using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization.,"Benzene degradation under anoxic conditions was first reported more than 25 years ago; however, the activation mechanism in the absence of oxygen remains elusive. Progress has been hindered by the difficulty in cultivating anaerobic benzene-degrading enrichment cultures. Our laboratory has sustained a methanogenic enrichment culture harboring <i>Desulfobacterota</i> ORM2, a benzene fermenter distinct from any known genus but related to other known or predicted benzene degraders. ORM2's slow doubling time (∼30 days) and extended lag phase after inoculation complicate its study. We developed a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probe for ORM2, revealing rod-shaped cells of variable length that tend to cluster with other organisms, particularly methanogens. Microscopy and genomic evidence suggest that ORM2 may produce extracellular polymeric substances, facilitating cell aggregation and possibly consuming energy that contributes to the lag phase. Interestingly, higher benzene concentrations (90-120 mg/L) appeared to reduce cell aggregation. This study visualized the cells of <i>Desulfobacterota</i> ORM2 within a methanogenic community, offering insights into spatial organization and potential strategies to enhance its growth rate.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08254
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Novel Insights into Hg<sup>0</sup> Oxidation in Rice Leaf: Catalase Functions and Transcriptome Responses.,"Rice leaves can assimilate atmospheric mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>), which is accumulated by grains and causes health risks to rice consumers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Hg<sup>0</sup> assimilation in rice leaves remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated catalase's (CAT) function in Hg<sup>0</sup> oxidation within rice leaves, as well as the Hg speciation and transcriptomic profiles of rice leaves exposed to Hg<sup>0</sup>. The inactivation of catalase reduced Hg<sup>0</sup> oxidation by 91% in the leaf homogenate and the Hg<sup>0</sup> oxidation rate increased along with CAT activity, showing the CAT's function in Hg<sup>0</sup> oxidation. Hg<sup>0</sup> was converted to Hg(cysteine)<sub>2</sub> complexes in the leaf. Transcriptomic results revealed that the expression levels of both <i>OsCATA</i> and <i>OsCATB</i> (catalase-encoding genes) increased with Hg concentration, suggesting the involvement of catalase-related molecular network in Hg<sup>0</sup> oxidation. Upstream transcription factors, including NAC (NAM-no apical meristem, ATAF-<i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription activation factor, and CUC-cup-shaped cotyledon), and ethylene-responsive transcription factor, are likely involved in catalase expression. Genes related to cysteine metabolism and amino acid transport appeared to regulate Hg accumulation. Our findings demonstrate the important function of catalase in Hg<sup>0</sup> oxidation within rice and are fundamental for developing genetically modified rice cultivars to minimize human Hg exposure health risks.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08658
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Heating-Induced Redox Property Dynamics of Peat Soil Dissolved Organic Matter in a Simulated Peat Fire: Electron Exchange Capacity and Molecular Characteristics.,"Peatlands store one-third of the world's soil organic carbon. Globally increased fires altered peat soil organic matter chemistry, yet the redox property and molecular dynamics of peat-dissolved organic matter (PDOM) during fires remain poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of postfire biogeochemical processes. Clarifying these dynamic changes is essential for effective peatland fire management. This study demonstrates temperature-dependent dynamic changes in the electron exchange capacity (EEC) of PDOM by simulating peat soil burning, significantly affecting microbial iron reduction. At low fire temperatures (200-250 °C), the EEC remains constant by releasing more phenolic moieties to enhance the electron-donating capacity (EDC). Higher temperatures (500 °C) diminish 90% of the EEC by consuming phenolic-quinone moieties. Pyrolytic PDOM (pyPDOM) contributes to 40% of the EEC of peat soil, with this contribution declining at higher temperatures. Phenolic-quinone moieties remain the primary redox-active moieties in pyPDOM. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis shows that postfire EDC depends more on phenolic types than abundance, with monophenol-like molecules (<i>C</i> < 12) being more significant than polyphenol-like (<i>C</i> ≥ 12). Quinone moieties in pyPDOM are associated with high-oxygen condensed aromatics, and their depletion reduces the electron-accepting capacity, weakening its electron shuttle effect in microbial iron reduction. Our findings enhance the understanding of the changes in PDOM redox properties during fires.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c09174
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Arsenic Exposure Triggers Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through Repressing <i>S</i>-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Histone Methylation in Rats.,"Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid widespread in the environment, and its exposure has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes. As exposure is demonstrated to cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the roles of histone modifications in low-level As exposure-induced NAFLD in rats. The results showed that exposure to As caused lipid accumulation and upregulated the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes <i>Fabp1</i>, <i>Srebf1</i>, and <i>Apoc3</i>, while downregulated <i>Acox1</i> and <i>Cpt1a</i> in rat liver. In addition, it was found that inorganic arsenite (iAs<sup>III</sup>) was methylated to DMA, and the <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level was decreased, which would contribute to the repression of H3K9me1/2 in rat liver after exposure. The in vitro studies revealed that SAM supplementation attenuated lipid accumulation by restoring H3K9me1/2 in HepG2 cells, which further confirmed our animal results. Therefore, it is suggested that As methylation depleted SAM, which inhibited H3K9me1/2 and activated <i>Fabp1</i>, <i>Srebf1</i>, and <i>Apoc3</i> expressions, leading to NAFLD upon inorganic As exposure. Overall, these data shed new light on the role of SAM-mediated histone methylation in As-triggered NAFLD, which could be useful for the prevention and intervention of hepatotoxicity induced by environmental As exposure.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c10417
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Unlocking Drivers of Country-Specific Sensitivities of Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Accumulation: Preparing for Future Pandemic Management.,"The global atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation trajectory has been subjected to fluctuations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Country-level virus prevalence and geography conditions added complexity to understanding atmospheric GHG accumulation sensitivities in terms of the growth rate. Here, extensive data sets were comprehensively analyzed to capture historical and projected fate of atmospheric GHG concentrations. Although a temporary slowdown was observed during the lockdown, global atmospheric GHG growing rates exhibited a sharp rebound during the early economic recovery after COVID-19, which would threaten climate goals without proactive measures. Despite this consistent global trend, various countries demonstrated differential relative changes in growth rates, representing their specific responses to the pandemic crisis. After systematic consideration of socio-economic and demographic factors and employment of optimal regression models, transportation and industry variables emerged as the strongest predictors for country-specific GHG accumulation sensitivities during lockdown and recovery phases, respectively. Addressing global health and climate change issues would necessitate sustainable government actions and economic decisions in anticipation of future pandemic-related events.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c09641
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Release of Bisphenol A and Other Volatile Chemicals from New Epoxy Drinking Water Pipe Liners: The Role of Manufacturing Conditions.,"Cured-in-place-pipe (CIPP) technology has begun to be adopted for drinking water pipe repairs, and limited information exists about its drinking water quality impacts. CIPP involves the manufacture of a new plastic pipe inside a buried damaged pipe. In this study, the chemical composition of the raw materials and CIPP water quality impacts were examined. Numerous (47) VOCs and SVOCs were found in the resin and two hardeners were studied. TGA results indicated that new CIPPs contained about 3.2-4.8 wt% VOC. A controlled static headspace analysis using PTR-TOF-MS detected eight protonated ions (<i>m</i>/<i>z</i> < 114) with mixing ratios above 1 ppb and phenol was identified as the most abundant VOC released into air. The analytical methods were unable to identify 99.9% of the extractable VOC mass. A 5% shorter curing duration had no impact on the chemical residual left in the CIPPs, but a 5% hardener reduction prompted an increase in the amount of monomer remaining. Both normal drying and quick drying formulations released similar amounts of 2-EHGE and BPA into drinking water. Laboratory results scaled to 4-36 in. diameter pipes indicated only 4 in. diameter CIPPs would cause BPA levels to exceed a U.S. state drinking water standard, EU, and WHO drinking water limits. Flushing and drinking water VOC and SVOC testing should be conducted before use. Additional studies of resins, manufacturing conditions, and wastes generated, are recommended. At present, the limited information available about these materials has shifted the burden of potential health and financial costs to the users.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08663

Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Estimating the Risk of Women Anemia Associated with Ozone Exposure Across 123 Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Multicenter Epidemiological Study.,"Anemia in women of reproductive age (WRA) presents a pressing global public health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Yet, the potential impact of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure on anemia remains uncertain. The study included 1,467,887 eligible women from 83 surveys of 45 LMICs between 2004 to 2020. Monthly O<sub>3</sub> exposure was estimated using machine learning, with the year preceding the survey as the primary exposure window. Fixed-effects models evaluated the association between O<sub>3</sub> and anemia. An exposure-response function (ERF) was constructed using a varying-coefficient regression model, and then extrapolated to estimate the anemia burden in relation to O<sub>3</sub> in 123 LMICs. In the fully adjusted regression model, each 10 ppb increase in annual O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with an 8% elevation in anemia risk. The nonlinear ERF indicated a threshold effect of O<sub>3</sub> on anemia at approximately 47.2 ppb. In 2020, more than 7.6 million anemic WRA (1.58%) in 123 LMICs were associated with O<sub>3</sub> exposure. The potentially attributable burden has generally decreased from 2004 to 2020, notably in South Asia. Our findings highlight the importance of air pollution mitigation in LMICs to address anemia disparities among women.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c07787
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Semen Associated with Repeated Measures of Semen Quality in Healthy Adult Men.,"Although epidemiological studies have explored the association between poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations and semen quality, existing findings are often inconsistent. Our work aimed to explore the association of PFAS in plasma and semen with repeated measures of semen quality parameters in healthy adults. Plasma was collected at the initial recruitment and semen was collected at least once within five predetermined intervals during an approximately 3-month period. Semen volume, concentration, motility, and total sperm count were measured in each semen specimen. PFAS was measured in individual plasma samples (<i>n</i> = 1252) and pooled semen samples (<i>n</i> = 1019) from multiple collections (or in a single semen sample if no multiple collection was available). The results reveal seminal perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate were significantly associated with decreased sperm progressive motility and total motility, while multiple seminal PFAS were positively associated with sperm concentration and total sperm count. By contrast, null associations were observed between plasma PFAS and semen quality. Our study provides epidemiological evidence that PFAS exposure may affect male fertility and seminal PFAS should be measured for precise assessment of the impact of PFAS on male reproductive performances.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c10425
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Diquat Induces Cell Death and dopamine Neuron Loss via Reactive Oxygen Species Generation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.,"Diquat (DQ), a contact herbicide extensively utilized in both agricultural and nonagricultural domains, exhibits a high correlation with neuronal disorders. Nevertheless, the toxicity and underlying mechanisms associated with exposure to environmental concentrations of DQ remain ambiguous. Here, we report dose-dependent cellular neurotoxicity of DQ in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. First, DQ significantly compromised the development and brood size of worms, shortened the lifespan, and caused epidermal abnormalities. An unbiased transcriptomic analysis disclosed several pathways related to cell death and peroxisome homeostasis underlying this organismal-level toxicity. Moreover, exposure of DQ to <i>C. elegans</i> led to a notable increase of embryonic cell death. Concurrently, DQ exposure specifically caused the loss of dopamine neurons but not two other types of neurons in adulthood, which is in accordance with DQ-induced muscle-related defects such as pharyngeal pumping, body bends, and head thrashes. Mechanistically, DQ exposure induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances glutathione-related ROS scavenging pathway. Protein levels and activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes were specifically impaired in the DQ-treated worms. Collectively, this study suggests an ROS-mediated cell death pathway involving the neuronal and behavioral toxicity of DQ, which offers a novel mitochondria-related perspective to elucidate the general toxicity caused by a widely distributed herbicide, DQ, at near-environment concentrations.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c07783
Environ Sci Technol,2025-Jan-14,Mineral Scaling in 3D Interfacial Solar Evaporators─A Challenge for Brine Treatment and Lithium Recovery.,"In this work, we analyzed the effects of mineral scaling on the performance of a 3D interfacial solar evaporator, with a focus on the cations relevant to lithium recovery from brackish water. The field has been rapidly moving toward resource recovery applications from brines with higher cation concentrations. However, the potential complications caused by common minerals in these brines other than NaCl have been largely overlooked. Therefore, in this study, we thoroughly examined the effects of two common cations (calcium and magnesium) on the long-term solar evaporation performance of a 3D graphene oxide stalk. The 3D stalk can achieve an evaporation flux as high as 17.8 kg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under one-sun illumination, and accumulation of NaCl on the stalk surface has no impact. However, the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> significantly reduces the evaporative flux even in solutions lacking scale-forming anions. A close examination of scale formation during long-term evaporation experiments revealed that CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> tend to precipitate out within the stalk, thus blocking water transport through the stalk and significantly dropping the evaporation rates. These findings imply that research attention is needed to modify and optimize the internal water transport channels for 3D evaporators. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of testing realistic mixtures─including prominent divalent cations─ and testing long-term operations in interfacial solar evaporation research and investigating approaches to mitigate the negative impacts of divalent cations.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08151
