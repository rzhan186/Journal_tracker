Nature,2025-Jun-18,Bimodal centromeres in pentaploid dogroses shed light on their unique meiosis.,"Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes<sup>1</sup>. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents<sup>2,3</sup>. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09171-z,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun-11,Discovery of FoTO1 and Taxol genes enables biosynthesis of baccatin III.,"Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules<sup>1,2</sup>, but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees (Taxus species)<sup>3</sup>. Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research<sup>4</sup>. Within Taxus' large, enzyme-rich genome<sup>5</sup>, we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3'-N-debenzoyl-2'-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09090-z,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,Sequence diversity lost in early pregnancy.,"Every generation, the human genome is shuffled during meiosis and a single fertilized egg gives rise to all of the cells of the body<sup>1</sup>. Meiotic errors leading to chromosomal abnormalities are known causes of pregnancy loss<sup>2,3</sup>, but genetic aetiologies of euploid pregnancy loss remain largely unexplained<sup>4</sup>. Here we characterize sequence diversity in early pregnancy loss through whole-genome sequencing of 1,007 fetal samples and 934 parental samples from 467 trios affected by pregnancy loss (fetus, mother and father). Sequenced parental genomes enabled us to determine both the parental and meiotic origins of chromosomal abnormalities, detected in half of our set. It further enabled us to assess de novo mutations on both homologous chromosomes from parents transmitting extra chromosomes, and date them, revealing that 6.6% of maternal mutations occurred before sister chromatid formation in fetal oocytes. We find a similar number of de novo mutations in the trios affected by pregnancy loss as in 9,651 adult trios, but three times the number of pathogenic small (<50 bp) sequence variant genotypes in the loss cases compared with adults. Overall, our findings indicate that around 1 in 136 pregnancies is lost due to a pathogenic small sequence variant genotype in the fetus. Our results highlight the vast sequence diversity that is lost in early pregnancy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09031-w,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,Multigenerational cell tracking of DNA replication and heritable DNA damage.,"Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear<sup>1,2</sup>. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution<sup>3-5</sup>. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08986-0,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,A pangenome reference of wild and cultivated rice.,"Oryza rufipogon, the wild progenitor of Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa, is an important resource for rice breeding<sup>1</sup>. Here we present a wild-cultivated rice pangenome based on 145 chromosome-level assemblies, comprising 129 genetically diverse O. rufipogon accessions and 16 diverse varieties of O. sativa. This pangenome contains 3.87 Gb of sequences that are absent from the O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare reference genome. We captured alternate assemblies that include heterozygous information missing in the primary assemblies, and identified a total of 69,531 pan-genes, with 28,907 core genes and 13,728 wild-rice-specific genes. We observed a higher abundance and a significantly greater diversity of resistance-gene analogues in wild rice than in cultivars. Our analysis indicates that two cultivated subpopulations, intro-indica and basmati, were generated through gene flows among cultivars in South Asia. We also provide strong evidence to support the theory that the initial domestication of all Asian cultivated rice occurred only once. Furthermore, we captured 855,122 differentiated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 13,853 differentiated presence-absence variations between indica and japonica, which could be traced to the divergence of their respective ancestors and the existence of a larger genetic bottleneck in japonica. This study provides reference resources for enhancing rice breeding, and enriches our understanding of the origins and domestication process of rice.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08883-6,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,The phased pan-genome of tetraploid European potato.,"Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century<sup>1,2</sup>. Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world<sup>3</sup>. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato 'Russet Burbank') using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08843-0,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,Mitochondrial metabolism sustains DNMT3A-R882-mutant clonal haematopoiesis.,"Somatic DNMT3A-R882 codon mutations drive the most common form of clonal haematopoiesis (CH) and are associated with increased acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) risk<sup>1,2</sup>. Preventing expansion of DNMT3A-R882-mutant haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) may therefore avert progression to AML. To identify DNMT3A-R882-mutant-specific vulnerabilities, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen on primary mouse Dnmt3a<sup>R882H/+</sup> HSPCs. Among the 640 vulnerability genes identified, many were involved in mitochondrial metabolism, and metabolic flux analysis confirmed enhanced oxidative phosphorylation use in Dnmt3a<sup>R882H/+</sup> versus Dnmt3a<sup>+/+</sup> (WT) HSPCs. We selected citrate/malate transporter Slc25a1 and complex I component Ndufb11, for which pharmacological inhibitors are available, for downstream studies. In vivo administration of SLC25A1 inhibitor CTPI2 and complex I inhibitors IACS-010759 and metformin suppressed post-transplantation clonal expansion of Dnmt3a<sup>R882H/+</sup>, but not WT, long-term haematopoietic stem cells. The effect of metformin was recapitulated using a primary human DNMT3A-R882 CH sample. Notably, analysis of 412,234 UK Biobank participants showed that individuals taking metformin had a markedly lower prevalence of DNMT3A-R882-mutant CH, after controlling for potential confounders including glycated haemoglobin, diabetes and body mass index. Collectively, our data propose modulation of mitochondrial metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for prevention of DNMT3A-R882-mutant AML.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08980-6,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,Genome-wide CRISPR screen in human T cells reveals regulators of FOXP3.,"Regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which specifically express the master transcription factor FOXP3, have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis and have the potential to revolutionize cell therapies for autoimmune diseases<sup>1-3</sup>. Although stimulation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-2 can induce FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in vitro (iT<sub>reg</sub> cells), the resulting cells are often unstable and have thus far hampered translational efforts<sup>4-6</sup>. A systematic approach towards understanding the regulatory networks that dictate T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation could lead to more effective iT<sub>reg</sub> cell-based therapies. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to catalogue gene regulatory determinants of FOXP3 induction in primary human T cells and characterized their effects at single-cell resolution using Perturb-icCITE-seq. We identify the RBPJ-NCOR repressor complex as a novel, context-specific negative regulator of FOXP3 expression. RBPJ-targeted knockout enhanced iT<sub>reg</sub> differentiation and function, independent of canonical Notch signalling. Repeated cytokine and T cell receptor signalling stimulation in vitro revealed that RBPJ-deficient iT<sub>reg</sub> cells exhibit increased phenotypic stability compared with control cells through DNA demethylation of the FOXP3 enhancer CNS2, reinforcing FOXP3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of RBPJ potently suppressed FOXP3 induction through direct modulation of FOXP3 histone acetylation by HDAC3. Finally, RBPJ-ablated human iT<sub>reg</sub> cells more effectively suppressed xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease than control iT<sub>reg</sub> cells in a humanized mouse model. Together, our findings reveal novel regulators of FOXP3 and point towards new avenues to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for autoimmune disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08795-5,Nature
Nature,2025-Jun,Genomic determinants of antigen expression hierarchy in African trypanosomes.,"Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery<sup>1,2</sup>. A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene-an important trigger for antigen switching-the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08720-w,Nature
Nat Microbiol,2025-Jun,Intragenic viral silencer element regulates HTLV-1 latency via RUNX complex recruitment.,"Retroviruses integrate their genetic material into the host genome, enabling persistent infection. Human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) share similarities in genome structure and target cells, yet their infection dynamics differ drastically. While HIV-1 leads to high viral replication and immune system collapse, HTLV-1 establishes latency, promoting the survival of infected cells and, in some cases, leading to leukaemia. The mechanisms underlying this latency preference remain unclear. Here we analyse blood samples from people with HTLV-1 and identify an open chromatin region within the HTLV-1 provirus that functions as a transcriptional silencer and regulates transcriptional burst. The host transcription factor RUNX1 binds to this open chromatin region, repressing viral expression. Mutation of this silencer enhances HTLV-1 replication and immunogenicity, while its insertion into HIV-1 suppresses viral production. These findings reveal a strategy by which HTLV-1 ensures long-term persistence, offering potential insights into retroviral evolution and therapeutic targets.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02006-7,Nature microbiology
