The cell membrane is an essential structure that is important for protection from the extracellular environment, signal transduction, and transport of nutrients. The polar membrane lipids of <i>C. difficile</i> are ~50% glycolipids, a higher percentage than most other organisms. The glycolipids of <i>C. difficile</i> consist of monohexosyldiradylglycerol (MHDRG) (~14%), dihexosyldiradylglycerol (DHDRG) (~15%), trihexosyldiradylglycerol (THDRG) (~5%), and a unique glycolipid aminohexosyl-hexosyldiradylglycerol (HNHDRG) (~16%). Previously, we found that HexSDF are required for the synthesis of HNHDRG. The enzymes required for the synthesis of MHDRG, DHDRG, and THDRG are not known. In this study, we identified the glycosyltransferases UgtA (CDR20291_0008), which is required for the synthesis of all glycolipids, and UgtB (CDR20291_1186), which is required for the synthesis of DHDRG and THDRG. We propose a model where UgtA synthesizes only MHDRG, HexSDF synthesize HNHDRG from MHDRG, and UgtB synthesizes DHDRG and potentially THDRG from MHDRG. We also report that glycolipids are important for critical cell functions, including sporulation, cell size and morphology, maintaining membrane fluidity, colony morphology, and resistance to some membrane-targeting antimicrobials.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03512-24

It has a wide host tropism because it uses several receptors to facilitate its attachment and entry. Thus far, not all the receptors have been identified. Here, we employed a BioID-based screening method to identify the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase alpha subunit (<i>Pv</i>ATP1A) as a potential receptor in <i>Penaeus vannamei</i>. Although during the early stages of WSSV infection<i>, Pv</i>ATP1A was induced and underwent oligomerization, clustering, and internalization, knockdown of <i>Pv</i>ATP1A inhibited viral entry and replication. <i>Pv</i>ATP1A interacted with the WSSV envelope protein VP28 through its multiple extracellular regions, whereas synthetic <i>Pv</i>ATP1A extracellular region peptides blocked WSSV entry and replication. We showed that <i>Pv</i>ATP1A did not affect WSSV attachment but facilitated internalization via caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. These findings provide a robust receptor screening approach that identified <i>Pv</i>ATP1A as an entry receptor for WSSV, presenting a novel target for the development of anti-WSSV therapeutics.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03787-24

This has been particularly true for fungal natural product studies. Strides in genome mining have led to the identification of an extraordinary number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across the fungal Kingdom and metabologenomic platforms can group BGCs into gene cluster families and link them to initial chemical structures. Missing are computational applications focused on identifying BGC regulatory networks. Here, we applied the new online gene regulatory network resource, GRAsp (<u>G</u>ene <u>R</u>egulation of <i><u>Asp</u>ergillus fumigatus</i>), to identify unknown and unpredictable BGC trans-acting transcriptional/metabolite production modules. GRAsp correctly predicted a two-component regulatory module composed of the transcription factors (TFs), RogA (<u>r</u>egulation <u>o</u>f <u>g</u>liotoxin) and HsfA, which negatively regulate the gliotoxin BGC and are also involved in gliotoxin self-protection. RogA functions through the repression of <i>gliZ,</i> the pathway-specific gliotoxin TF, and HsfA functions by activating <i>rogA</i> expression. Furthermore, GRAsp identified TFs that regulate the production of two BGCs lacking pathway-specific TFs, the helvolic acid and fumitremorgin BGCs, respectively. Finally, the known TF, NsdD, was predicted and found to regulate the hexadehydroastechrome BGC. These advances highlight the power of inference algorithms to uncover unpredictable networks in specialized metabolite synthesis.IMPORTANCEToxic secondary metabolites are virulence factors of the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus,</i> yet the transcriptional networks regulating secondary metabolite production remain elusive. Uncovering novel regulators without any prior information is challenging. Computational programs have gained prominence in the field of secondary metabolite research due to their accuracy and ability to handle vast amounts of data, including DNA, RNA, and protein data. In this study, a newly developed online computer platform, Gene Regulation of <i>A. fumigatus</i>, was used to identify five regulators involved in the production of several <i>A. fumigatus</i> toxins, including gliotoxin, helvolic acid, fumitremorgin, and hexadehydroastechrome. This work illustrates the potential for discovering new trans-acting regulators and mechanisms of secondary metabolite regulation through the examination of computational gene regulatory networks.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03874-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '14'}",Rickettsial pathogen augments tick vesicular-associated membrane proteins for infection and survival in the vector host.,"<i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i> is an obligate intracellular rickettsial pathogen that infects humans and animals. The black-legged tick <i>Ixodes scapularis</i> acts as a vector and transmits this bacterium to the vertebrate host. Upon entry into a host cell, <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> resides and multiplies in a host-derived vacuole called morulae. There is not much information available on the molecules that play an important role(s) in <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> entry and formation of these morulae in tick cells. In this study, we provide evidence that tick vesicular-associated membrane proteins, VAMP3 and VAMP4, play important roles in this phenomenon. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis showed that both <i>vamp3</i> and <i>vamp4</i> transcripts are significantly upregulated at early time points of <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> infection in tick cells. We noted that both VAMP3 and VAMP4 predominantly localized to the <i>A. phagocytophilum</i>-containing vacuole. RNAi-mediated silencing of <i>vamp3</i> and/or <i>vamp4</i> expression, followed by confocal microscopy and expression analysis, indicated an impairment in <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> morulae formation in tick cells. We also noted that VAMP3 and VAMP4 play a role in the <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> persistent infection of ticks and tick cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of expression of arthropod <i>vamp3</i> and <i>vamp4</i> affected bacterial acquisition from an infected murine host to ticks. Collectively, this study not only provides evidence on the role of arthropod vesicular-associated membrane proteins in <i>A. phagocytophilum</i> morulae formation in tick cells but also demonstrates that these proteins are important for bacterial acquisition from an infected vertebrate host into ticks.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03549-24

Previous studies demonstrated that CPS plays multiple functional roles, but the mechanism by which this virulence factor enhances the survival fitness of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that CPS is the main cellular component that not only elicits the host immune response to <i>K. pneumoniae</i> but also enables this pathogen to survive for a prolonged period under adverse environmental conditions. Consistently, our <i>in vitro</i> experiments suggest that CPS prevents <i>K. pneumoniae</i> from phagocytosis, rendering the encapsulated strain more difficult to be eradicated by the host. We also found that phagocytosis of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> is partially mediated by LOX-1, a scavenger receptor of the host, and that CPS may impede interaction between LOX-1 and this pathogenic bacteria, therefore reducing the phagocytosis process. These findings provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of this important clinical pathogen and should facilitate the design of new strategies to combat <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infections.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03838-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '13'}",Persistent delay in maturation of the developing gut microbiota in infants with cystic fibrosis.,"The healthy human infant gut microbiome undergoes stereotypical changes in taxonomic composition between birth and maturation to an adult-like stable state. During this time, extensive communication between microbiota and the host immune system contributes to health status later in life. Although there are many reported associations between microbiota compositional alterations and disease in adults, less is known about how microbiome development is altered in pediatric diseases. One pediatric disease linked to altered gut microbiota composition is cystic fibrosis (CF), a multi-organ genetic disease involving impaired chloride secretion across epithelia and heightened inflammation both in the gut and at other body sites. Here, we use shotgun metagenomics to profile the strain-level composition and developmental dynamics of the infant fecal microbiota from several CF and non-CF longitudinal cohorts spanning from birth to greater than 36 months of life. We identify a set of keystone species that define microbiota development in early life in non-CF infants but are missing or decreased in relative abundance in infants with CF, resulting in a delayed pattern of microbiota maturation, persistent entrenchment in a transitional developmental phase, and subsequent failure to attain an adult-like stable microbiota. Delayed maturation is strongly associated with cumulative antibiotic treatments, and we also detect the increased relative abundance of oral-derived bacteria and higher levels of fungi in infants with CF, features that are associated with decreased gut bacterial density. These findings suggest the potential for future directed therapies targeted at overcoming developmental delays in microbiota maturation for infants with CF.IMPORTANCEThe human gastrointestinal tract harbors a diversity of microbes that colonize upon birth and collectively contribute to host health throughout life. Infants with the disease cystic fibrosis (CF) harbor altered gut microbiota compared to non-CF counterparts, with lower levels of beneficial bacteria. How this altered population is established in infants with CF and how it develops over the first years of life is not well understood. By leveraging multiple large non-CF infant fecal metagenomic data sets and samples from a CF cohort collected prior to highly effective modulator therapy, we define microbiome maturation in infants up to 3 years of age. Our findings identify conserved age-diagnostic species in the non-CF infant microbiome that are diminished in abundance in CF counterparts that instead exhibit an enrichment of oral-derived bacteria and fungi associated with antibiotic exposure. Together, our study builds toward microbiota-targeted therapy to restore healthy microbiota dynamics in infants with CF.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03420-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '11'}",The DnaJK chaperone of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> post-transcriptionally regulates gene expression through the YlxR(RnpM)/RNase P complex.,"To survive in harsh natural environments, translation and mRNA metabolism must be tightly and coordinately controlled, as saving biological costs increases fitness. However, the roles of protein chaperones in this control system are unclear. This study proposes the novel aspect of the link between translation and mRNA metabolism, that is, the co-translational DnaJK chaperone activity is involved in changes in mRNA metabolism by RNase P. We found that the expression of <i>proBA,</i> which encodes proline biosynthetic enzymes, is regulated by <i>ylxR</i>(<i>rnpM</i>) through the <i>proBA</i> promoter. YlxR(RnpM), which is associated with RNase P, was also involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of <i>proBA</i>. To clarify this posttranscriptional regulation, we screened transposon (Tn)-inserted mutants for cells with low <i>proB::lacZ</i> expression and identified the DnaJK chaperone as a regulator of <i>proB</i>. To explore the possibility that the complex of YlxR(RnpM) and RNase P might work with DnaJK, we performed an epistatic analysis using the <i>lacZ</i> fusions, which revealed that the regulation of <i>proB</i> by DnaJK/YlxR(RnpM)/RNase P, that is, co-translational chaperone activity, controlled mRNA metabolism. RNA sequencing analysis of cells deficient in the RNA component of RNase P (<i>rnpB</i>) revealed that 261 genes were upregulated in the <i>rnpB</i>::Tn strain. Among them, we identified <i>yoyD/yodF, besA</i>, and <i>epeXE,</i> which were also under the control of DnaJK/YlxR(RnpM)/RNase P regulatory cascade. Finally, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis using DnaK as bait and identified two genes, <i>spoIVCA</i> and <i>nupG</i>, whose expression was post-transcriptionally regulated by DnaJK but independent of YlxR(RnpM). These results suggest a broader role for posttranscriptional gene regulation by DnaJK.IMPORTANCE<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> lacking the DnaJK chaperone has not been reported to exhibit a distinct phenotype. However, our study revealed proline-dependent growth in a minimal medium in the <i>dnaJ</i>::Tn strain. Inhibition of <i>spoIVCA</i> expression in this strain was identified as a probable cause of the sporulation deficiency in previous and current studies using a single cell-level analysis. We also observed posttranscriptional regulation of <i>proBA</i> by the DnaJK and YlxR(RnpM)/RNase P complex. LacZ analyses of <i>proB::lacZ</i> in different backgrounds suggested that the above regulation ultimately functions in mRNA metabolism. In DnaJK-deficient cells, the nascent peptide may be misfolded, and if DnaJK chaperone activity is lost, such a signal may be transferred to RNase P. Therefore, <i>proBA</i> mRNA may be degraded in an RNase P-dependent manner if the misfolding of the polypeptide translated from this mRNA is detected. This system is useful for reducing the biological costs of futile mRNA elongation.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.04053-24

The ongoing outbreak is a public health crisis affecting both humans and animals, as interspecies transmission has emerged as a common characteristic of this virus. As of 12 December 2024, >30 humans have been infected in the United States related to dairy cow exposure. In this mGem, we discuss transmission modalities between cows within herds, the spread of the virus between dairy farms, and exposure risks for humans. We also highlight major gaps in knowledge constituting barriers to our ability to effectively control the spread of H5N1 in dairy cows and reduce the risks to humans.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02944-24

As illustrated by mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), viruses can bind several types of receptors using distinct capsid components to facilitate the viral entry steps of attachment, internalization, and disassembly. The outer of the two concentric capsids of reovirus virions is formed by four viral proteins, three of which bind receptors. These capsid-receptor interactions mediate stepwise entry of reovirus, dictate viral tropism in infected animals, and expand the viral host range. Engagement of independent receptors by different capsid proteins is a property of many pathogenic viruses and illustrates common themes of receptor use in viral entry and disease.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02964-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '11'}",Identification of intratumoral bacteria that enhance breast tumor metastasis.,"The central, mortality-associated hallmark of cancer is the process of metastasis. It is increasingly recognized that bacteria influence multiple facets of cancer progression, but the extent to which tumor microenvironment-associated bacteria control metastasis in cancer is poorly understood. To identify tumor-associated bacteria and their role in metastasis, we utilized established murine models of non-metastatic and metastatic breast tumors to identify bacteria capable of driving metastatic disease. We found several species of the <i>Bacillus</i> genus that were unique to metastatic tumors, and found that breast tumor cells cultured with a <i>Bacillus</i> bacterium isolated from metastatic tumors, <i>Bacillus thermoamylovorans</i>, produced nearly 3× the metastatic burden as control cells or cells cultured with bacteria from non-metastatic breast tumors. We then performed targeted metabolomics on tumor cells cultured with different bacterial species and found that <i>B. thermoamylovorans</i> differentially regulated tumor cell metabolite profiles compared to bacteria isolated from non-metastatic tumors. Using these bacteria, we performed <i>de novo</i> sequencing and tested for the presence of genes that were unique to the bacterium isolated from metastatic tumors in a patient population to provide a proof-of-concept for identifying how specific bacterial functions are associated with the metastatic process in cancer independent of bacterial species. Together, our data directly demonstrate the ability of specific bacteria to promote metastasis through interaction with cancer cells.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03595-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '11'}",mGem: A quarter century with the Pirofski-Casadevall damage response framework-a dynamic construct for understanding microbial pathogenesis.,"A quarter of a century ago, Liise-anne Pirofski and Arturo Casadevall shared their concepts of microbial pathogenesis through the lens of a damage-response framework (DRF), which characterizes disease by assessing the dynamic interactions between the host and pathogen as reflected by damage as the readout. This framework has evolved to be a powerful tool for understanding the biology of complex infectious diseases, analyzing emerging and reemerging microbes, and developing therapeutic approaches to combat infections. The DRF is also frequently used to explain research at scientific meetings and to teach microbial pathogenesis to diverse learners. This mGem reviews how the DRF came to be and provides an overview of how it is used. Without a doubt, the scientific community will continue to leverage the DRF to advance research and innovate therapeutic approaches, which is especially important as new and reemerging infectious diseases threaten global health.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02945-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '11'}",Borrelial phosphomannose isomerase as a cell surface localized protein that retains enzymatic activity and promotes host-pathogen interaction.,"All organisms produce an intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) or mannose-6 phosphate isomerase, that catalyzes the reversible conversion of mannose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate during sugar metabolism and polysaccharide biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, we discovered an additional PMI function in <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, the pathogen of Lyme disease, where the enzyme is localized on the cell surface and binds to collagen IV-a host extracellular matrix component predominantly found in the skin. The AlphaFold 3-based structural model of <i>B. burgdorferi</i> PMI (BbPMI) retains the active site with tetrahedrally-coordinated Zn<sup>2+</sup> seen in other PMIs of known structure, residing in an elongated crevice. Ligand docking shows that the crevice can accommodate the tip trisaccharide moiety of a glycosylated asparagine residue on the collagen IV 7S domain. Low doses of a well-known PMI benzoisothiazolone inhibitor impair the growth of diverse strains of <i>B. burgdorferi</i> in culture, but not other tested Gram-negative or Gram-positive pathogens. <i>Borrelia</i> cells are even more susceptible to several other structurally related benzoisothiazolone analogs. The passive transfer of anti-BbPMI antibodies in ticks can impact spirochete transmission to mice, while the treatment of collagen IV-containing murine skin with PMI inhibitors impairs spirochete infectivity. Taken together, these results highlight a newly discovered role for BbPMI in mediating host-pathogen interactions during the spirochete infectivity process. In turn, this discovery offers an opportunity for the development of a novel therapeutic strategy to combat Lyme disease by preventing the BbPMI interaction with its host receptor, collagen IV.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03609-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '07'}",Phage reprogramming of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> amino acid metabolism drives efficient phage replication.,"Phages have been shown to use diverse strategies to commandeer bacterial host cell metabolism during infection. However, for many of the physiological changes in bacteria during infection, it is often unclear if they are part of a bacterial response to infection or if they are actively driven by the phage itself. Here, we identify two phage proteins that promote efficient phage replication by reprogramming host amino acid metabolism. These proteins, Eht1 and Eht2, are expressed early in the infection cycle and increase the levels of key amino acids and the arginine-derived polyamine putrescine. This provides a fitness advantage as these metabolites are important for phage replication and are often depleted during infection. We provide evidence that Eht1 and Eht2 alter the expression of bacterial host metabolic genes, and their activities may impinge on metabolism-related signaling processes. This work provides new insight into how phages ensure access to essential host resources during infection and the competitive advantage this provides.IMPORTANCEBacterial viruses, known as phages, are abundant in all environments that are inhabited by bacteria. During the infection process, phages exploit bacterial resources, resulting in notable changes to bacterial metabolism. However, precise mechanisms underlying these changes, and if they are driven by the phage or are a generalized bacterial response to infection, remain poorly understood. We characterized two proteins in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> phage JBD44 whose activities alter bacterial host metabolism to optimize phage replication. Our work provides insight into how phages control bacterial processes to ensure access to essential host resources during infection.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02466-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '07'}",Inhibition of TIGIT on NK cells improves their cytotoxicity and HIV reservoir eradication potential.,"The latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reservoir presents the biggest obstacle to curing HIV chronic infection. Consequently, finding novel strategies to control the HIV reservoir is critical. Natural killer (NK) cells are essential for antiviral immunity. However, the influence of NK cell subsets and their associated inhibitory or activating receptors on their cytotoxicity toward the HIV reservoir has not been fully studied. We investigated the relationship between the percentage of NK cells or NK cell subsets and the HIV reservoir. Our results indicated that the percentage of CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells was positively associated with HIV reservoir size (i.e., HIV DNA, HIV msRNA, or HIV usRNA). Additionally, we observed that the percentage of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> NK cells was inversely related to the HIV reservoir. Furthermore, the expression of TIGIT on NK cells, particularly CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cell subsets, positively correlated with the HIV reservoir. Notably, individuals with higher percentage of TIGIT<sup>+</sup> NK and lower percentage of CD226<sup>+</sup> NK cells exhibited larger HIV reservoir. Mechanistically, we discovered that TIGIT could inhibit the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-mTORC1 (s6k) signaling pathway to decrease the production of IFN-γ in NK cells. Importantly, inhibiting TIGIT in NK cells enhanced their ability to eliminate reactivated latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our experiments underscored the crucial role of NK cells in controlling the HIV reservoir and suggested that TIGIT serves as a promising target for enhancing the NK cell-mediated clearance of the HIV reservoir.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03226-24

Here, we use negative stain electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (nsEMPEM) to structurally characterize the humoral IgG antibody responses to hemagglutinin (HA) from human patients vaccinated with a seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine or infected with influenza A viruses. Our data show that both vaccinated and infected patients had humoral IgGs targeting highly conserved regions on both H1 and H3 subtype HAs, including the stem and anchor, which are targets for universal influenza vaccine design. Responses against H1 predominantly targeted the central stem epitope in infected patients and vaccinated donors, whereas head epitopes were more prominently targeted on H3. Responses against H3 were less abundant, but a greater diversity of H3 epitopes were targeted relative to H1. While our analysis is limited by sample size, on average, vaccinated donors responded to a greater diversity of epitopes on both H1 and H3 than infected patients. These data establish a baseline for assessing polyclonal antibody responses in vaccination and infection, providing a context for future vaccine trials and emphasizing the need for further characterization of protective responses toward conserved epitopes. (201 words)IMPORTANCESeasonal influenza viruses cause hundreds of thousands of deaths each year and up to a billion infections; under the proper circumstances, influenza A viruses with pandemic potential could threaten the lives of millions more. The variable efficacies of traditional influenza virus vaccines and the desire to prevent pandemic influenzas have motivated work toward finding a universal flu vaccine. Many promising universal flu vaccine candidates currently focus on guiding immune responses to highly conserved epitopes on the central stem of the influenza hemagglutinin viral fusion protein. To support the further development of these stem-targeting vaccine candidates, in this study, we use negative stain electron microscopy to assess the prevalence of central stem-targeting antibodies in individuals who were exposed to influenza antigens through traditional vaccination and/or natural infection during the 2018-2019 flu season.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02030-24

However, invertebrate bites are not well recognized as a mechanism for the inoculation of fungi into subcutaneous tissue that can also result in severe infections. Invertebrates often carry fungi with human pathogenic potential as part of their microbiome, and bites break the skin, providing a conduit for them to penetrate subcutaneous tissues where the establishment of infection can produce serious skin and soft tissue fungal diseases. In this essay, we review the existing data for invertebrate bite-associated cutaneous invasive fungal infections (IBA-cIFIs) and consider the potential consequences of global warming on their epidemiology. Climate changes will be associated with changes in the range of invertebrates and adaptation of their associated microbes to warmer temperatures. Fungal adaptation to higher temperatures can defeat the mammalian protective barrier and be associated with both more and different IBA-cIFIs.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03447-24

Actin-based motility of <i>R. parkeri</i> enables bacteria to enter protrusions of the host cell plasma membrane that are engulfed by neighboring host cells. However, whether and how RickA and Sca2 independently contribute to cell-to-cell spread <i>in vitro</i> or pathogenicity <i>in vivo</i> has been unclear. Using live cell imaging of <i>rickA</i>::Tn and <i>sca2</i>::Tn mutants, we discovered both RickA and Sca2 contribute to different modes of cell-to-cell spread. Compared with Sca2-spread, RickA-spread involves the formation of longer protrusions that exhibit larger fluctuations in length and take a longer time to be engulfed into neighboring cells. We further compared the roles of RickA and Sca2 <i>in vivo</i> following intradermal (i.d.) infection of <i>Ifnar1</i><sup>-/-</sup>; <i>Ifngr1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice carrying knockout mutations in the genes encoding the receptors for IFN-I (<i>Ifnar1</i>) and IFN-γ (<i>Ifngr1</i>), which exhibit eschars and succumb to infection with wild-type (WT) <i>R. parkeri</i>. We observed that RickA is important for severe eschar formation, whereas Sca2 contributes to larger foci of infection in the skin and dissemination from the skin to the internal organs. Our results suggest that actin-based motility effectors RickA and Sca2 drive two distinct forms of cell-to-cell spread and contribute differently to pathogenicity in the mammalian host.IMPORTANCE<i>Rickettsia parkeri</i>, a bacterium in the spotted fever group of <i>Rickettsia</i> species, can be transmitted from ticks to humans, leading to symptoms including fever, rash, muscle aches, and a lesion at the site of the tick bite. During <i>Rickettsia parkeri</i> infection, bacteria invade cells within the animal host, proliferate in the host cell's cytosol, move using a process called actin-based motility, and spread to neighboring host cells. <i>Rickettsia parkeri</i> is unusual in having two bacterial proteins that mediate actin-based motility. The significance of our research is to reveal that each of these bacterial actin-based motility proteins contributes differently to spread between cells and to the signs of infection in a mouse model of spotted fever disease. Our results are important for understanding the contribution of actin-based motility to mammalian infection by <i>Rickettsia parkeri</i> as well as to infection by other bacterial and viral pathogens that require this process to spread between cells and cause disease.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02563-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '05'}",Mapping <i>C. difficile</i> TcdB interactions with host cell-surface and intracellular factors using proximity-dependent biotinylation labeling.,"Many bacterial toxins exert their cytotoxic effects by enzymatically inactivating one or more cytosolic targets in host cells. To reach their intracellular targets, these toxins possess functional domains or subdomains that interact with and exploit various host factors and biological processes. Despite great progress in identifying many of the key host factors involved in the uptake of toxins, significant knowledge gaps remain as to how partially characterized and newly discovered microbial toxins exploit host factors or processes to intoxicate target cells. Proximity-dependent biotinylation (e.g., BioID) is a powerful method to identify nearby host factors in living cells, offering the potential to identify host targets of microbial toxins. Here, we used BioID to interrogate proximal interactors of the multi-domain <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> TcdB toxin. Expressed fusions of TurboID to different fragments of TcdB identified several high-confidence proteins in the cytosol, including members of the Rho GTPase signaling network and the actin cytoskeletal network. Additionally, we developed an extracellular proximity labeling method using recombinant TurboID-toxin chimeras, which uncovered a limited number of cell-surface targets including LRP1, which was previously identified as a cell-surface receptor of TcdB. Our work reveals surface receptors and intracellular components exploited by bacterial toxins, highlighting key vulnerabilities in host cells.IMPORTANCEBacterial toxins are the causative agents of many human diseases. Further characterizing the intoxication mechanisms of these proteins is important for the development of vaccines and treatments for toxin-mediated disease. Proximity-dependent biotinylation approaches offer an orthogonal approach to complement genetic screens. Here, we evaluate the potential of this method to identify host-toxin interactions on the cell surface and in the cytosol, where the toxin modifies essential host targets.

The molecular basis for the broad recognition of these viruses by the KRM1 receptor remains unclear. Here, we report the indispensable role of the completely conserved VP2 capsid protein residue K140 (designated K2140) in mediating receptor recognition and infection by CVA10 and other KRM1-dependent enteroviruses. Residue K2140 not only facilitates receptor recognition, cell attachment, and infection of CVA10 but also contributes to CVA10 pathogenicity <i>in vivo</i>. Notably, residue K2140 is completely conserved in all strains of the KRM1-dependent enteroviruses. Mutational analysis confirms the importance of K2140 for infection by CVA2-CVA6, and CVA12. Moreover, CVA8, an enterovirus for which the cellular receptor has not yet been identified, also possesses the conserved K2140 residue. We experimentally demonstrate that CVA8 utilizes KRM1 as its receptor, with K2140 being essential for viral infection. Additionally, residue D90 of KRM1 engages with residue K2140 and plays a crucial role in KRM1-mediated enterovirus infections. Collectively, our findings underscore the significance of the absolutely conserved K2140 residue in receptor interactions and infection of all KRM1-binding enteroviruses, providing novel insights into the molecular basis of enterovirus infection and informing the development of broad-spectrum therapies against HFMD.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03040-24

However, unknown AI-2 receptors in bacteria may be more than what has been discovered so far, and there are still many unknown functions for this signal waiting to be explored. Here, we have identified a membrane-bound histidine kinase of the pathogenic bacterium <i>Vibrio furnissii</i>, AsrK, as a receptor that specifically detects AI-2 under low boron conditions. In contrast with another well-known AI-2 receptor LuxP that recognizes the borated form of AI-2, AsrK is found to show higher affinity with AI-2 under borate-depleted conditions, and thus boron has a negative effect on AI-2 sensing by AsrK in regulation of the biofilm and motility phenotypes. AI-2 binds to the extracytoplasmic dCache_1 domain of AsrK to inhibit its autokinase activity, thus decreasing the phosphorylation level of its cognate response regulator AsrR and activating the phosphodiesterase activity of AsrR to degrade the cellular second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). AI-2 perception by the AsrK-AsrR system remarkably reduces intracellular c-di-GMP levels and enhances tolerance of <i>V. furnissii</i> to oxidative stress and DNA damage by upregulating the transcription of universal stress proteins including UspA1, UspA2, and UspE. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism for AI-2 detection in bacteria and also provides new insights into the important role of AI-2 in bacterial defense against oxidative stress and DNA damage.IMPORTANCEThe QS signal AI-2 is widely synthesized in bacteria and has been implicated in the regulation of numerous bacterial group behaviors. However, in contrast to the wide distribution of this signal, its receptors have only been found in a small number of bacterial species, and the underlying mechanisms for the detection of and response to AI-2 remain elusive in most bacteria. It is worth noting that the periplasmic protein LuxP is the uniquely identified receptor for AI-2 in <i>Vibrio</i> spp. Here, we identify a second type of AI-2 receptor, a membrane-bound histidine kinase with a periplasmic dCache_1 sensory domain, in a member of the genus <i>Vibrio</i>, and thus show that AI-2 enhances the defense of <i>V. furnissii</i> against oxidative stress and DNA damage by modulation of c-di-GMP signaling via the AsrK-AsrR two-component system. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized AI-2 sensing mechanism and expand our understanding of the physiological roles of AI-2 in bacteria.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02922-24

However, the impact of subsurface snow algae (e.g., when cells are covered by recent snowfall) on albedo is unknown. Here, we examined the impact of subsurface snow algae on surface energy absorption by adding up to 2 cm of clean snow to surface algal blooms and measuring reflectivity. Surprisingly, snow algae still absorb significant energy across an array of wavelengths when snow-covered. Furthermore, the scale of this effect correlates with algal cell densities and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Collectively, our results suggest that darkening by subsurface snow algae lowers albedo and thus potentially accelerates snowmelt even when the algae is snow-covered. Impacts of subsurface algae on melt await assessment. This implies that snow algae play a larger role in cryosphere melt than investigations of surface-only reflectance would suggest.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03630-24

Immunocompetent host immune responses, such as formation of pulmonary granulomas, control the infection and prevent disseminated disease. Little is known about the immunological conditions establishing the latent infection granuloma in the lungs. To investigate this, we performed an analysis of pulmonary immune cell populations, cytokine changes, and granuloma formation during infection with a latent disease-causing clinical isolate in C3HeB/FeJ mice over 360 days. We found that latently infected mice progress through three phases of granuloma formation where different immune profiles dominate: an early phase characterized by eosinophilia, high IL-4/IL-13, and <i>C. neoformans</i> proliferation in the lungs; an intermediate phase characterized by multinucleated giant cell formation, high IL-1α/IFNγ, granuloma expansion, and increased blood antigen levels; and a late phase characterized by a significant expansion of T cells, granuloma condensation, and decreases in lung fungal burden and blood antigen levels. These findings highlight a complex series of immune changes that occur during the establishment of granulomas that control <i>C. neoformans</i> in the lungs and lay the foundation for studies to identify critical beneficial immune responses to <i>Cryptococcus</i> infections.IMPORTANCE<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is a fungal pathogen that disseminates from the lungs to the brain to cause fatal disease. Latent C. <i>neoformans</i> infection in the lungs is controlled by organized collections of immune cells called granulomas. The formation and structure of <i>Cryptococcus</i> granulomas are poorly understood due to inconsistent human pathology results and disagreement between necrotic granuloma-forming rat models and non-necrotic granuloma-forming mouse models. To overcome this, we investigated granuloma formation during latent <i>C. neoformans</i> infection in the C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain which forms necrotic lung granulomas in response to other pathogens. We found that latent <i>C. neoformans</i> granuloma formation progresses through phases that we described as early, intermediate, and late with different immune response profiles and granulomatous characteristics. Ultimately, we show that C3HeB/FeJ mice latently infected with <i>C. neoformans</i> form non-necrotic granulomas and could provide a novel mouse model to investigate host immune response profiles.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03610-24

Fap2 is a fusobacteria-specific outer membrane galactose-binding lectin that mediates <i>Fusobacterium</i> adherence to and invasion of CRC tumors. Advances in omics analyses provide an opportunity to profile and identify microbial genomic features that correlate with the cancer-associated bacterial virulence factor Fap2. Here, we analyze genomes of <i>Fusobacterium</i> colon tumor isolates and find that a family of post-translational modification enzymes containing Fic domains is associated with Fap2 positivity in these strains. We demonstrate that Fic family genes expand with the presence of Fap2 in the fusobacterial pangenome. Through comparative genomic analysis, we find that Fap2<sup>+</sup> Fusobacteriota are highly enriched with Fic gene families compared to other cancer-associated and human gut microbiome bacterial taxa. Using a global data set of CRC shotgun metagenomes, we show that fusobacterial Fic and Fap2 genes frequently co-occur in the fecal microbiomes of individuals with late-stage CRC. We further characterize specific Fic gene families harbored by Fap2<sup>+</sup> <i>Fusobacterium animalis</i> genomes and detect recombination events and elements of horizontal gene transfer via synteny analysis of Fic gene loci. Exposure of a <i>F. animalis</i> strain to a colon adenocarcinoma cell line increases gene expression of fusobacterial Fic and virulence-associated adhesins. Finally, we demonstrate that Fic proteins are synthesized by <i>F. animalis</i> as Fic peptides are detectable in <i>F. animalis</i> monoculture supernatants. Taken together, our study uncovers Fic genes as potential virulence factors in Fap2<sup>+</sup> fusobacterial genomes.IMPORTANCEAccumulating data support that bacterial members of the intra-tumoral microbiota critically influence colorectal cancer progression. Yet, relatively little is known about non-adhesin fusobacterial virulence factors that may influence carcinogenesis. Our genomic analysis and expression assays in fusobacteria identify Fic domain-containing genes, well-studied virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria, as potential fusobacterial virulence features. The Fic family proteins that we find are encoded by fusobacteria and expressed by <i>Fusobacterium animalis</i> merit future investigation to assess their roles in colorectal cancer development and progression.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03732-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '05'}",Reverse transcriptase inhibitors diminish systemic proinflammatory responses to bacterial pathogens.,"Bacterial infections can induce exuberant immune responses that can damage host tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that systemic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection in mice causes tissue damage in the liver. This liver necrosis is associated with the expression of endogenous retroviruses, chromosomally integrated retroviruses that encode a reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) completely prevent tissue damage and subsequent bacterial growth within necrotic lesions. Since liver necrosis is linked to heightened systemic inflammatory responses, we hypothesized that NRTIs diminish inflammation caused by <i>E. coli</i> infection and may also have broad impacts on the systemic immune response to bacterial pathogens. Here, we tested this hypothesis by characterizing the effects of NRTIs on the innate immune response to bacteria. In the liver, NRTI administration following <i>E. coli</i> inoculation reduced the expression of a large repertoire of proinflammatory transcripts. NRTIs also had systemic anti-inflammatory effects, including reducing proinflammatory cytokine levels in serum in response to <i>E. coli</i> in different mouse strains. The anti-inflammatory effects of NRTIs were also apparent in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory functions of NRTIs are likely conserved across distinct immune signaling pathways. Moreover, in a model of lethal LPS shock, NRTI administration prevented hypothermia and death. Together, our observations reveal that NRTIs can potently impede systemic inflammatory responses during Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. Our findings lay the groundwork for further investigation of the therapeutic scope of NRTIs and the mechanisms underlying their anti-inflammatory effects across non-retroviral infectious diseases.IMPORTANCEInflammatory responses are critical for host control of bacterial infection, but excessive inflammation can damage host tissues and lead to sepsis. Understanding how innate immune responses are controlled during infection is important for developing new approaches to dampen excessive inflammation. In previous work, we found that tissue damage caused by excessive inflammatory responses may be driven by endogenous reverse transcriptases. Here we demonstrate that treatment of mice with reverse transcriptase inhibitors leads to broad reductions in systemic proinflammatory responses during bacterial infections and can protect mice from acute death in a lethal model of sepsis. Our findings indicate that uncovering the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory functions of reverse transcriptase inhibitors may lead to new therapeutics for bacterial infectious diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03412-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '05'}",Microcephaly protein ANKLE2 promotes Zika virus replication.,"Orthoflaviviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that hijack host proteins to promote their own replication. Zika virus (ZIKV) is infamous among orthoflaviviruses for its association with severe congenital birth defects, notably microcephaly. We previously mapped ZIKV-host protein interactions and identified the interaction between ZIKV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) and host microcephaly protein ankyrin repeat and LEM domain-containing 2 (ANKLE2). Using a fruit fly model, we showed that NS4A induced microcephaly in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Here, we explore the role of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication to understand the biological significance of the interaction from a viral perspective. We observe that ANKLE2 localization is drastically shifted to sites of NS4A accumulation during infection and that knockout of ANKLE2 reduces ZIKV replication in multiple human cell lines. This decrease in virus replication is coupled with a moderate increase in innate immune activation. Using microscopy, we observe dysregulated formation of virus-induced endoplasmic reticulum rearrangements in ANKLE2 knockout cells. Knockdown of the ANKLE2 ortholog in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> cells also decreases virus replication, suggesting ANKLE2 is a beneficial replication factor across hosts. Finally, we show that NS4A from four other orthoflaviviruses physically interacts with ANKLE2 and is also beneficial to their replication. Thus, ANKLE2 likely promotes orthoflavivirus replication by regulating membrane rearrangements that serve to accelerate viral genome replication and protect viral dsRNA from immune detection. Taken together with our previous results, our findings indicate that ZIKV and other orthoflaviviruses hijack ANKLE2 for a conserved role in replication, and this drives unique pathogenesis for ZIKV since ANKLE2 has essential roles in developing tissues.IMPORTANCEZIKV is a major concern due to its association with birth defects, including microcephaly. We previously identified a physical interaction between ZIKV NS4A and host microcephaly protein ANKLE2. Mutations in ANKLE2 cause congenital microcephaly, and NS4A induces microcephaly in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Here, we establish the role of ANKLE2 in ZIKV replication. Depletion of ANKLE2 from cells significantly reduces ZIKV replication and disrupts virus-induced membrane rearrangements. ANKLE2's ability to promote ZIKV replication is conserved in mosquito cells and for other related mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses. Our data point to an overall model in which ANKLE2 regulates virus-induced membrane rearrangements to accelerate orthoflavivirus replication and avoid immune detection. However, ANKLE2's unique role in ZIKV NS4A-induced microcephaly is a consequence of ZIKV infection of important developing tissues in which ANKLE2 has essential roles.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02683-24

Here, we show that two different MgmA homologs are able to methylate MCR <i>in vivo</i> when expressed in <i>Methanosarcina acetivorans</i>, an organism that does not normally possess this PTM. <i>M. acetivorans</i> strains expressing MgmA showed small, but significant, reductions in growth rates and yields on methylotrophic substrates. Structural characterization of the Ni(II) form of Gln-methylated <i>M. acetivorans</i> MCR revealed no significant differences in the protein fold between the modified and unmodified enzyme; however, the purified enzyme contained the heterodisulfide reaction product, as opposed to the free cofactors found in eight prior <i>M. acetivorans</i> MCR structures, suggesting that substrate/product binding is altered in the modified enzyme. Structural characterization of MgmA revealed a fold similar to other B12-dependent rSAMs, with a wide active site cleft capable of binding an McrA peptide in an extended, linear conformation.IMPORTANCEMethane plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and is an important driver of climate change. Because MCR is responsible for nearly all biological methane production and most anoxic methane consumption, it plays a major role in setting the atmospheric levels of this important greenhouse gas. Thus, a detailed understanding of this enzyme is critical for the development of methane mitigation strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03546-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '05'}",Delay of innate immune responses following influenza B virus infection affects the development of a robust antibody response in ferrets.,"Due to its natural influenza susceptibility, clinical signs, transmission, and similar sialic acid residue distribution, the ferret is the primary animal model for human influenza research. Antibodies generated following infection of ferrets with human influenza viruses are used in surveillance to detect antigenic drift and cross-reactivity with vaccine viruses and circulating strains. Inoculation of ferrets, with over 1,500 human clinical influenza isolates (1998-2019) resulted in lower antibody responses (HI <1:160) to 86% (387 out of 448) influenza B viruses (IBVs) compared to 2.7% (30 out of 1,094) influenza A viruses (IAVs). Here, we show that the immune responses in ferrets inoculated with IBV were delayed and reduced compared to IAV. Innate gene expression in the upper respiratory tract and blood indicated that IAV generated a strong inflammatory response, including an early activation of the interferon (IFN), whereas IBV elicited a delayed and reduced response. Serum levels of cytokines and IFNs were all much higher following IAV infection than IBV infection. Pro-inflammatory, IFN, TH1/TH2, and T-effector proteins were significantly higher in sera of IAV-infected than IBV-infected ferrets over 28 days following the challenge. Serum levels of Type-I/II/III IFNs were detected following IAV infection throughout this period, whereas Type-III IFN was only late for IBV. An early increase in IFN-lambda corresponded to gene expression following IAV infection. Reduced innate immune responses following IBV infection reflected the subsequent delayed and reduced serum antibodies. These findings may help in understanding the antibody responses in humans following influenza vaccination or infection and consideration of potential addition of innate immunomodulators to overcome low responses.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02361-24

The increasing development of antibiotic resistance in this organism is a global health concern. The <i>A. baumannii</i> clinical isolate AB307-0294 produces a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that delivers three antibacterial effector proteins that give this strain a competitive advantage against other bacteria in polymicrobial environments. Each effector, Tse15, Tde16, and Tae17, is delivered <i>via</i> a non-covalent interaction with a specific T6SS VgrG protein (VgrG15, VgrG16, and VgrG17, respectively). Here we define the regions of interaction between Tae17 and its cognate delivery protein VgrG17 and identify that amino acids G1069 and W1075 in VgrG17 are essential for Tae17 delivery <i>via</i> the T6SS, the first time such specific delivery determinants of T6SS cargo effectors have been defined. Furthermore, we determine that the Tae17 effector is a multidomain, bifunctional, peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme that has both amidase activity, which targets the sugar-peptide bonds, and lytic transglycosylase activity, which targets the peptidoglycan sugar backbone. Moreover, we show that the Tae17 transglycosylase activity is more important than amidase activity for the killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. This study provides molecular insight into how the T6SS allows <i>A. baumannii</i> strains to gain dominance in polymicrobial communities and thus improve their chances of survival and transmission.IMPORTANCEWe have shown that the <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> T6SS effector Tae17 is a modular, bifunctional, peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme that has both lytic transglycosylase and amidase activities. Both activities contribute to the ability to degrade peptidoglycan, but the transglycosylase activity was more important for the killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We have defined the specific regions of Tae17 and its cognate delivery protein VgrG17 that are necessary for the non-covalent interactions and, for the first time, identified specific amino acids essential for T6SS cargo effector delivery.

The impact on the cells that survive viral infection in the distal lung epithelia, however, is much less well-characterized. Utilizing a Cre-expressing influenza B virus (IBV) and a lox-stop-lox tdTomato reporter mouse model, we identified that alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes, a progenitor cell type in the distal lung, can survive viral infection. We show that survival of infection is associated with transcriptional dysregulation compared to bystander AT2 pneumocytes from the same lung. Furthermore, <i>ex vivo</i> experiments revealed a significant reduction in proliferation rates in survivor AT2 pneumocytes compared to matched, non-directly infected bystander cells. Our findings not only enhance our understanding of the AT2 pneumocyte response to IBV infection but could also have broader implications for the mechanisms of respiratory epithelial repair post-viral infection.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02743-24

Moreover, multiple zoonotic infections in humans have been reported. Importantly, HPAI H5N1 viruses with genetic markers of adaptation to mammals have been detected. Together with HPAI H5N1, avian influenza viruses H7N9 (high and low pathogenic) stand out due to their high mortality rates in humans. This raises the question of how prepared we are serologically and whether seasonal vaccines are capable of inducing protective immunity against these influenza subtypes. An observational study was conducted in which sera from people born between years 1925-1967, 1968-1977, and 1978-1997 were collected before or after 28 days or 6 months post-vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Then, hemagglutination inhibition, viral neutralization, and immunoassays were performed to assess the basal protective immunity of the population as well as the ability of seasonal influenza vaccines to induce protective responses. Our results indicate that subtype-specific serological protection against H5N1 and H7N9 in the representative Spanish population evaluated was limited or nonexistent. However, seasonal vaccination was able to increase the antibody titers to protective levels in a moderate percentage of people, probably due to cross-reactive responses. These findings demonstrate the importance of vaccination and suggest that seasonal influenza vaccines could be used as a first line of defense against an eventual pandemic caused by avian influenza viruses, to be followed immediately by the use of more specific pandemic vaccines.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A viruses (IAV) can infect and replicate in multiple mammalian and avian species. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs primarily in poultry and wild water birds. Due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of AIV, there is a continuing risk that new IAV could emerge and rapidly spread worldwide, causing a pandemic, if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. The aim of this study is to analyze the basal protection and presence of antibodies against IAV H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes in the population from different ages. Moreover, we have evaluated the humoral response after immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine. This study is strategically important to evaluate the level of population immunity that is a major factor when assessing the impact that an emerging IAV strain would have, and the role of seasonal vaccines to mitigate the effects of a pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03721-24

The functional consequence of this diversity remains unknown mainly because, to date, functional genomic studies in <i>Mab</i> have been primarily performed on reference strains. Given the growing public health threat of <i>Mab</i> infections, understanding the functional genomic differences among <i>Mab</i> clinical isolates can provide more insight into how its genetic diversity influences gene essentiality, clinically relevant phenotypes, and importantly, potential drug targets. To determine the functional genomic diversity among <i>Mab</i> strains, we conducted transposon-sequencing (TnSeq) on 21 genetically diverse clinical isolates, including 15 <i>M</i>. <i>abscessus</i> subsp. <i>abscessus</i> isolates and 6 <i>M</i>. <i>abscessus</i> subsp. <i>massiliense</i> isolates, cataloging all the essential and non-essential genes in each strain.

We identified 259 core essential genes across the 21 clinical isolates and 425 differentially required genes, representing ~10% of the <i>Mab</i> core genome. We also identified genes whose requirements were subspecies, lineage, and isolate-specific. Finally, by correlating TnSeq profiles, we identified 19 previously uncharacterized genetic networks in <i>Mab</i>.

The phylogenetic diversity of the yeast is clustered in five major clades, among which clade III is particularly relevant, as most of its strains exhibit resistance to fluconazole, reducing the therapeutic alternatives and provoking outbreaks that are difficult to control. In this study, we have investigated the phylogenetic structure of clade III by analyzing a global collection of 566 genomes. We have identified three subgroups within clade III, among which two are genetically most closely related. Moreover, we have estimated the evolutionary rate of clade III to be 2.25e-7 s/s/y (2.87 changes per year). We found that one of these subgroups shows intrinsic resistance to fluconazole and is responsible for the majority of cases within this clade globally. We inferred that this subgroup may have originated around December 2010 (95% High Probability Density (HPD): April 2010-June 2011), and since then it has spread across continents, generating multiple large outbreaks, each with a unique pattern of transmission and dissemination. These results highlight the remarkable ability of the pathogen to adapt to its environment and its rapid global spread, underscoring the urgent need to address this epidemiological challenge effectively.IMPORTANCEThe number of cases affected by <i>Candida auris</i> has increased worryingly worldwide. Among the currently recognized clades, clade III has the highest proportion of fluconazole-resistant cases and is spreading very rapidly, causing large nosocomial outbreaks across the globe. By analyzing complete fungal genomes from around the world, we have confirmed the origin of this clade and unraveled its dispersal patterns in the early 2010s.

While <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is known to exhibit a robust competitive response toward other bacterial species, this bacterium is frequently identified in polymicrobial infections where multiple species survive. For example, in prosthetic joint infections, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> can be identified along with other pathogenic bacteria including <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, and <i>Corynebacterium striatum</i>. Here, we have explored the survival and behavior of such microbes and find that <i>E. faecalis</i> readily survives culturing with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> while other tested species do not. In each of the tested conditions, <i>E. faecalis</i> growth remained unchanged by the presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, indicating a unique mutualistic interaction between the two species. We find that <i>E. faecalis</i> proximity leads <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to attenuate competitive behaviors as exemplified by reduced production of <i>Pseudomonas</i> quinolone signal and pyocyanin. Reduced alkyl quinolones are important to <i>E. faecalis</i> as these will grow in supernatant from a quinolone mutant but not <i>P. aeruginosa</i> wild-type in planktonic culture. The reduced pyocyanin production of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is attributable to production of ornithine by <i>E. faecalis</i>, which we recapitulate by adding exogenous ornithine to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> monocultures. Similarly, co-culture with an ornithine-deficient strain of <i>E. faecalis</i> leads <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to yield near monoculture amounts of pyocyanin. Here, we directly demonstrate how notorious pathogens such as <i>P. aeruginosa</i> might persist in polymicrobial infections under the influence of metabolites produced by other bacterial species.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03320-24

Bacterial motility is known to contribute to host colonization. We have previously identified pseudovibriamides A and B, produced in culture by <i>Pseudovibrio brasiliensis</i> Ab134, and shown that pseudovibriamide A promotes flagellar motility. Pseudovibriamides are encoded in a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase gene cluster that also includes several accessory genes. Pseudovibriamide A is a linear heptapeptide and pseudovibriamide B is a nonadepsipeptide derived from pseudovibriamide A. Here, we define the borders of the pseudovibriamides gene cluster, assign function to biosynthetic genes using reverse genetics, and test the hypothesis that pseudovibriamides impact motility by modulating gene transcription. RNA-sequencing transcriptomic analyses of strains having different compositions of pseudovibriamides suggested that both pseudovibriamides A and B affect genes potentially involved in motility, and that a compensatory mechanism is at play in mutants that produce only pseudovibriamide A, resulting in comparable flagellar motility as the wild type. The data gathered suggest that pseudovibriamides A and B have opposite roles in modulating a subset of genes, with pseudovibriamide B having a primary effect in gene activation, and pseudovibriamide A on inhibition. Finally, we observed many differentially expressed genes (up to 29% of the total gene number) indicating that pseudovibriamides have a global effect on transcription that goes beyond motility.IMPORTANCEMarine sponges are found throughout the oceans from tropical coral reefs to polar sea floors, playing crucial roles in marine ecosystems. <i>Pseudovibrio</i> bacteria have been proposed to contribute to sponge health. We have previously shown that pseudovibriamides produced by <i>Pseudovibrio brasiliensis</i> promote bacterial motility, a behavior that is beneficial to bacterial survival and host colonization. The gene cluster that encodes pseudovibriamide biosynthesis is found in two-thirds of <i>Pseudovibrio</i> genomes. This gene cluster is also present in <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria that interact with terrestrial plants and animals. Here, we first assign functions to pseudovibriamide biosynthetic genes using reverse genetics. We then show that pseudovibriamides play a major role in transcriptional regulation, affecting up to 29% of <i>P. brasiliensis</i> genes, including motility genes. Thus, this work gives insights into pseudovibriamide biosynthesis and provides evidence that they are signaling molecules relevant to bacterial motility and to other yet-to-be-identified phenotypes.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03115-24

Contrary to expectations, we report that wild-type <i>B. burgdorferi</i> B31 cells are radiosensitive, with a gamma-radiation survival limit for 10<sup>6</sup> wild-type cells of <1 kGy. Thus, we explored <i>B. burgdorferi</i> radiosensitivity through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by quantitating the fraction of Mn<sup>2+</sup> present as antioxidant Mn<sup>2+</sup> metabolite complexes (H-Mn). The spirochetes displayed relatively low levels of H-Mn, in stark contrast to the extremely radiation-resistant <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>. The H-Mn content as revealed by EPR spectroscopy is sufficiently sensitive to detect small changes in radiosensitivity among <i>B. burgdorferi</i> strains. However, <i>B. burgdorferi</i> cells are significantly more sensitive than predicted by EPR, implicating their linear genome architecture as an additional explanation for radiosensitivity. We then explored the influence of the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-decapeptide-phosphate antioxidant complex MDP, known to shield proteins during irradiation, and showed that treatment with MDP preserves <i>B. burgdorferi's</i> epitopes at 5 kGy irradiation, which crucially prevents cell proliferation. This finding defines some of the pivotal mechanisms that <i>B. burgdorferi</i> evolved to survive oxidative conditions experienced with tick and mammal immune responses. These observations also provide an opportunity for innovative vaccine development strategies employing ionizing radiation to disrupt the <i>B. burgdorferi</i> genome, while maintaining antigenic potency. These fresh insights extend our understanding of the unique biology of <i>B. burgdorferi</i> and open new avenues for considering novel whole-cell Lyme disease vaccines using MDP and irradiation-based inactivation.IMPORTANCEThe study highlights that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is sufficiently sensitive to detect small differences in radiation resistance among <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> strains based on their population of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-metabolite complexes (H-Mn). <i>B. burgdorferi</i> appears to have evolved a system not to protect from irradiation, but presumably to protect from oxidative stress when cyclically transmitted from tick to mammalian host and back. These data also suggest a path forward in the development of novel vaccines against spirochete infections, including Lyme disease, through preparation involving the synthetic Mn<sup>2+</sup>-decapeptide-phosphate antioxidant complex MDP to provide <i>B. burgdorferi</i> epitope protection during sterilizing gamma-irradiation that eliminates growth. Given the current lack of effective whole-cell vaccines for Lyme disease, this research identifies a potential strategy for developing alternative radiation-inactivated, yet highly effective vaccines.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03131-24

Although this host-microbe interaction is critical to establishing and maintaining marine animal populations, the functional activity of bacterial products and how they activate the host's metamorphosis program has not yet been defined for any animal. The marine bacterium <i>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</i> stimulates the metamorphosis of a tubeworm called <i>Hydroides elegans</i> by producing a molecular syringe called metamorphosis-associated contractile structures (MACs). MACs stimulate metamorphosis by injecting a protein effector termed metamorphosis-inducing factor 1 (Mif1) into tubeworm larvae. Here, we show that MACs bind to tubeworm cilia and form visible pores on the cilia membrane surface, which are smaller and less numerous in the absence of Mif1. <i>In vitro</i>, Mif1 associates with eukaryotic lipid membranes and possesses phospholipase activity. MACs can also deliver Mif1 to human cell lines and cause parallel phenotypes, including cell surface binding, membrane disruption, calcium flux, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Finally, MACs can also stimulate metamorphosis by delivering two unrelated membrane-disrupting proteins, MLKL and RegIIIɑ. Our findings demonstrate that membrane disruption by MACs and Mif1 is necessary for <i>Hydroides</i> metamorphosis, connecting the activity of a bacterial protein effector to the developmental transition of a marine animal.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03573-24

One well-known and broadly conserved stress response in bacteria is the stringent response, mediated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp. (p)ppGpp is produced in response to amino acid starvation and other nutrient limitations and stresses and regulates both the activity of proteins and expression of genes. <i>Escherichia coli</i> also makes inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), an ancient molecule evolutionary conserved across most bacteria and other cells, in response to a variety of stress conditions, including amino acid starvation. PolyP can act as an energy and phosphate storage pool, metal chelator, regulatory signal, and chaperone, among other functions. Here we report that <i>E. coli</i> lacking both (p)ppGpp and polyP have a complex phenotype indicating previously unknown overlapping roles for (p)ppGpp and polyP in regulating cell division, cell morphology, and metabolism. Disruption of either (p)ppGpp or polyP synthesis led to the formation of filamentous cells, but simultaneous disruption of both pathways resulted in cells with heterogenous cell morphologies, including highly branched cells, severely mislocalized Z-rings, and cells containing substantial void spaces. These mutants also failed to grow when nutrients were limited, even when amino acids were added. These results provide new insights into the relationship between polyP synthesis and the stringent response in bacteria and point toward their having a joint role in controlling metabolism, cell division, and cell growth.IMPORTANCECell division is a fundamental biological process, and the mechanisms that control it in <i>Escherichia coli</i> have been the subject of intense research scrutiny for many decades. Similarly, both the (p)ppGpp-dependent stringent response and inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) synthesis are well-studied, evolutionarily ancient, and widely conserved pathways in diverse bacteria. Our results indicate that these systems, normally studied as stress-response mechanisms, play a coordinated and novel role in regulating cell division, morphology, and metabolism even under non-stress conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03511-24

Recent studies have demonstrated that in cultured cells, HIV-1 uses multiple transcription start sites to generate several unspliced RNA species, including two major transcripts with three and one 5' guanosine, referred to as 3G and 1G RNA, respectively. Although nearly identical, 1G RNA is selected over 3G RNA to be packaged as the virion genome, indicating that these RNA species are functionally distinct. Currently, our understanding of HIV-1 transcription start site usage and the functions of RNA species is based on studies using cultured cells. Here, we examined samples from people living with HIV to investigate HIV-1 transcription start site usage and its impact on RNA function. Using paired samples collected from the same participants on the same date, we examined the HIV-1 unspliced RNA species in infected cells (PBMC) and in viruses (plasma). Our findings demonstrate that in people living with HIV, the virus uses multiple transcription start sites to generate several unspliced transcripts, including 3G and 1G RNA. Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of 1G RNA in the paired plasma samples, indicating a preferential packaging of 1G RNA <i>in vivo</i>. Our study illustrates the complex regulation of HIV-1 unspliced RNA in people living with HIV and provides valuable insights into how HIV-1 unspliced RNAs serve their functions <i>in vivo</i>.IMPORTANCEHIV-1 virions must contain unspliced RNA and its translation products to maintain infectivity. How HIV-1 unspliced RNA fulfills these two essential and yet distinct roles in viral replication has been a long-standing question in the field. In this report, we demonstrate that in people living with HIV, the virus uses multiple transcription start sites to generate several unspliced RNA species that are 99% identical in sequence but differ functionally. One of the RNA species, 1G RNA, is selected over other HIV-1 unspliced RNAs to be packaged into viral particles.

Resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides is particularly concerning as this compromises the two most effective oral antibiotic agents currently available for human campylobacteriosis. Here, we report on the prevalence and worldwide distribution of the operon <i>cmeRABC</i>, which encodes an efflux pump conferring high levels of combined resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides in <i>Campylobacter</i> strains isolated from poultry (<i>n</i> = 75) and children (<i>n</i> = 177). These mutations were found to be highly prevalent in isolates from poultry (62.7%) and children (29.4%) in Iquitos, Peru. We investigated the population structure of genes in the <i>cmeRABC</i> operon and identified a potential genetic bottleneck for the <i>cmeA</i> and <i>cmeB</i> genes. While most <i>cmeB</i> alleles segregate by species, alleles associated with high resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides were found in both <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> and <i>Campylobacter coli</i>. We inferred that the likely ancestry of these alleles was from <i>C. jejuni</i> and was later acquired by <i>C. coli</i> through recombination. Publicly accessible global genomic data from 16,120 <i>Campylobacter</i> genomes identified these mutations in approximately 6% of <i>C. jejuni</i> and <i>C. coli</i> isolates globally, with higher prevalence in samples from poultry in many countries, including Peru. Our findings suggest that these extensively drug-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> strains originated from <i>C. jejuni</i> in poultry.IMPORTANCEAntimicrobial resistance in <i>Campylobacter</i> is a growing public health concern, driven by the rapid evolution and zoonotic transmission of resistant strains. This study focuses on mutations in the cmeABC efflux pump, which confer high resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides, the two most effective oral antibiotics for human campylobacteriosis. By analyzing genomes from poultry and children in Iquitos, Peru, as well as global genomic data sets, we identified a significant prevalence of these resistance-associated mutations, particularly in poultry and children. Our findings suggest that these mutations originated in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> and spread to <i>C. coli</i> through recombination. Globally, these mutations are found in approximately 6% of isolates, with higher prevalence in poultry in multiple countries.

Here we investigated the molecular assembly, regulation, and function of BMCs in <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum-</i>a Gram-negative oral pathobiont that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The <i>F. nucleatum</i> genome harbors a conserved ethanolamine utilization (<i>eut</i>) locus with 21 genes that encode several putative BMC shell proteins and a two-component signal transduction system (TCS), in addition to the enzymes for ethanolamine transport and catabolism. We show that the expression of most of these genes and BMC formation are highly increased in wild-type fusobacteria when cultured in the presence of ethanolamine as a nutrient source. Deletion of the response regulator EutV eliminated this induction of <i>eut</i> mRNAs and BMCs, thus demonstrating that BMC formation is transcriptionally regulated by the TCS EutV-EutW in response to ethanolamine. Mass spectrometry of isolated BMCs unveiled the identity of the constituent proteins EutL, EutM<sub>1</sub>, EutM<sub>2</sub>, and EutN. Consistent with the role of these proteins in BMC assembly and metabolism, deletion of <i>eutN</i>, <i>eutL</i>/<i>eutM<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>eutM<sub>2</sub></i>, or <i>eutL</i>/<i>eutM<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>eutM<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>eutN</i> not only affected BMC formation but also ethanolamine utilization, causing cell growth defects with ethanolamine as a nutrient. BMCs are also assembled in fusobacteria cultured with placental cells or the culture media, a process that is dependent on the BMC shell proteins. Significantly, we show that the <i>eutN</i> mutant is defective in inducing preterm birth in a mouse model. Together, these results establish that the BMC-mediated metabolism of ethanolamine is critical for fusobacterial virulence.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03405-24

The impact of evolutionary trajectories on the long-term success of phage therapy remains largely unclear. Herein, we conducted evolutionary experiments, genomic analysis, and CRISPR-mediated gene editing, to illustrate the evolutionary trajectory occurring between phages and their hosts. Our results illustrate the ongoing ""arms race"" between a lytic phage and its host, a carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> clinical strain Kp2092, suggesting their respective evolutionary adaptations that shape the efficacy of phage therapy. Specifically, Kp2092 rapidly developed resistance to phages through mutations in a key phage receptor (<i>galU</i>) and bacterial membrane defenses such as LPS synthesis, however, this evolution coincides with unexpected benefits. Evolved bacterial clones not only exhibited increased sensitivity to clinically important antibiotics but also displayed a loss of virulence in an <i>in-vivo</i> model. In contrast, phages evolved under the selection pressure against Kp2092 mutants and exhibited enhanced bacterial killing potency, targeting mutations in phage tail proteins gp12 and gp17. These parallel evolutionary trajectories suggest a common genetic mechanism driving adaptation, ultimately favoring the efficacy of phage therapy. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of phages not only as agents for combating bacterial resistance, but also a driver of evolution outcomes that could lead to more favorable clinical outcomes in the treatment of multidrug resistance pathogens.IMPORTANCECarbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> represents one of the leading pathogens for infectious diseases. With traditional antibiotics often being ineffective, phage therapy has emerged as a promising alternative. However, phage predation imposes a strong evolutionary pressure on the rapid evolution of bacteria, challenging treatment efficacy. Our findings illustrate how co-evolution enhances phage lytic capabilities through accumulated mutations in the tail proteins gp12 and gp17, while simultaneously reducing bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance. These insights advance our understanding of phage-host interactions in clinical settings, potentially inspiring new approaches akin to an ""arms race"" model to combat multidrug-resistant crises effectively.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02957-24

Our previous work reported the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (PIP<sub>2</sub>) signaling in the actin-dependent pathogenicity of <i>T. vaginalis</i>. This study further demonstrated that iron transiently regulated <i>T. vaginalis</i> phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (<i>Tv</i>PI4P5K) proteostasis and its complex formation with an active ADP ribosylation factor <i>Tv</i>Arf220, facilitating co-trafficking to the plasma membrane, crucial for PIP<sub>2</sub> production. In dominant-active HA-<i>Tv</i>Arf220 Q71L mutant, <i>Tv</i>PI4P5K plasma membrane trafficking, PIP<sub>2</sub> production, and intracellular calcium levels were increased, while these processes were inhibited in dominant-negative T31N mutant or those by Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment. Additionally, PIP<sub>2</sub> replenishment reversed these inhibitions in the T31N mutant, suggesting the critical role of <i>Tv</i>Arf220 activation in PIP<sub>2</sub>-calcium signaling. Also, T31N mutant and BFA treatment impaired actin dynamics and cytoskeleton-dependent processes in <i>T. vaginalis</i>, further linking the role of <i>Tv</i>Arf220 to PIP<sub>2</sub>-calcium-dependent actin dynamics. Beyond cytoadherence, during host-parasite interactions, <i>Tv</i>Arf220 influenced both contact-dependent and -independent cytotoxicity, as well as phagocytotic capacity, contributing to the cytopathogenesis of human vaginal epithelial cells. Our findings underscore the key upstream regulation mechanisms of the PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling, orchestrating the interplay between <i>Tv</i>Arf220-PIP<sub>2</sub>-calcium signaling and downstream actin cytoskeleton-driven pathogenicity in <i>T. vaginalis</i>.IMPORTANCE<i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> actin cytoskeleton-centric pathogenicity is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (PIP<sub>2</sub>)-triggered calcium signaling cascade in response to environmental iron, though the detailed mechanism by which iron modulates PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling remains unclear. Our findings reveal that iron rapidly induces <i>T. vaginalis</i> phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (<i>Tv</i>PI4P5K) translation followed by its degradation, while simultaneously activating <i>Tv</i>Arf220 binding, which facilitates <i>Tv</i>PI4P5K localization to the plasma membrane for PIP<sub>2</sub> production. In contrast to the <i>Tv</i>Arf220 Q71L mutant, the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> production, intracellular calcium, actin assembly, morphogenesis, and cytoadherence in the dominant-negative T31N mutant were recovered by PIP<sub>2</sub> supplementation, indicating the essential role of <i>Tv</i>Arf220 in PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent calcium signaling.

Here, we performed an analysis of epitope data curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). We found that the patterns of immunodominance of seasonal influenza viruses circulating in humans and H5N1 are similar. We further conclude that a significant fraction of the T-cell epitopes is conserved at a level associated with cross-reactivity between avian and seasonal sequences, and we further experimentally demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity in the most dominant T-cell epitopes curated in the IEDB. Based on these observations, and the overall similarity of the neuraminidase (NA) N1 subtype encoded in both HPAI and seasonal H1N1 influenza virus as well as cross-reactive group 1 HA stalk-reactive antibodies, we expect that a degree of pre-existing immunity is present in the general human population that could blunt the severity of human H5N1 infections.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) cause pandemics that can result in millions of deaths. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype is presently among the top viruses of pandemic concern, according to the WHO and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Previous exposure by infection and/or vaccination to a given IAV subtype or clade influences immune responses to a different subtype or clade. Analysis of human CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitope conservation between HPAI H5N1 and seasonal IAV sequences revealed levels of identity and conservation conducive to T cell cross-reactivity, suggesting that pre-existing T cell immune memory should, to a large extent, cross-recognize avian influenza viruses.

Here, we performed a transposon insertion site sequencing loss-of-function screen to identify <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> genes that promote pathogen fitness in stationary phase. We discovered that the <u>m</u>aintenance of <u>l</u>ipid <u>a</u>symmetry (Mla) pathway, which is crucial for transferring phospholipids from the outer to the inner membrane, is critical for stationary phase fitness. Competition experiments with barcoded and fluorophore labeled wild-type (WT) and <i>mlaE</i> mutant <i>V. cholerae</i> revealed that the Mla pathway promotes re-expansion from 48 h stationary phase cultures. The mutant defect in transitioning out of stationary phase into active growth (culturability) was also observed in monocultures at 48 h. However, by 96 h the culturability of the WT and mutant strains were equivalent. By monitoring the abundances of genomically barcoded libraries of WT and ∆<i>mlaE</i> strains, we observed that a few barcodes dominated the mutant culture at 96 h, suggesting that the similarity of the population sizes at this time was caused by expansion of a subpopulation containing a mutation that suppressed the defect of ∆<i>mlaE</i>. Whole genome sequencing revealed that <i>mlaE</i> suppressors inactivated flagellar biosynthesis. Additional mechanistic studies support the idea that the Mla pathway is critical for maintaining the culturability of <i>V. cholerae</i> because it promotes energy homeostasis, likely due to its role in regulating outer membrane vesicle shedding.

Thorough protein annotation and comparison are essential to get insights into the functions of viral proteins and virus evolution. In addition to sequence- and hmm profile‑based methods, protein structure comparison adds a powerful tool to uncover protein functions and relationships. We constructed an Orthornavirae ""structurome"" consisting of already annotated as well as unannotated (""dark matter"") proteins and domains encoded in viral genomes. We used protein structure modeling and similarity searches to illuminate the remaining dark matter in hundreds of thousands of orthornavirus genomes. The vast majority of the dark matter domains showed either ""generic"" folds, such as single α-helices, or no high confidence structure predictions. Nevertheless, a variety of lineage-specific globular domains that were new either to orthornaviruses in general or to particular virus families were identified within the proteomic dark matter of orthornaviruses, including several predicted nucleic acid-binding domains and nucleases. In addition, we identified a case of exaptation of a cellular nucleoside monophosphate kinase as an RNA-binding protein in several virus families.

The prevalence and variation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in China have been increasing in complexity due to extensive interlineage recombination. When this recombination phenomenon occurs in live vaccine strains, it becomes increasingly difficult to prevent and control PRRSV. Reverse genetic manipulation to engineer a different transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) circuit introduces genetic traps into the viral genome that are lethal to recombinant RNA progeny viruses. In this study, major interlineage recombination patterns were identified between lineage 1 (L1) PRRSVs and lineage 8 (L8) PRRSVs in China, from 2019 to 2023. The recombinant mutant virus, vA-TRSall, was constructed and successfully rescued by rewiring the entire TRS circuit without changing the amino acid-coding sequence in the genome of the PRRSV live vaccine strain vHuN4-F112. The vA-TRSall, with a brand new TRS circuit, provided effective immune protection against the highly pathogenic L8 PRRSV (vHuN4) and epidemic NADC30-like L1 PRRSV (vZJqz21). Recombination analysis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> showed that, compared with the vHuN4-F112 and vZJqz21 co-infection groups, the incidence rates of mutation breakpoints and template-switching recombination in the vA-TRSall and vZJqz21 co-infected groups were effectively reduced.

Conjugation systems on most natural plasmids are repressed by default. The negative regulation of F-plasmid conjugation is partially mediated by the chromosomal nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS). Recent bioinformatic analyses have revealed that plasmid-encoded H-NS homologs are widespread and exhibit high sequence diversity. However, the functional roles of most of these homologs and the selective forces driving their phylogenetic diversification remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the functionality and evolution of Sfx, a H-NS homolog encoded by the model IncX2 plasmid R6K. We demonstrate that Sfx, but not chromosomal H-NS, can repress R6K conjugation. Notably, we find evidence of positive selection acting on the ancestral Sfx lineage. Positively selected sites are located in the dimerization, oligomerization, and DNA-binding interfaces, many of which contribute to R6K repression activity-indicating that adaptive evolution drove the functional divergence of Sfx. We additionally show that Sfx can physically interact with various chromosomally encoded proteins, including H-NS, StpA, and Hha. Hha enhances the ability of Sfx to regulate R6K conjugation, suggesting that Sfx retained functionally important interactions with chromosomal silencing proteins. Surprisingly, the loss of Sfx does not negatively affect the stability or dissemination of R6K in laboratory conditions, reflecting the complexity of selective pressures favoring conjugation repression. Overall, our study sheds light on the functional and evolutionary divergence of a plasmid-borne H-NS-like protein, highlighting how these loosely specific DNA-binding proteins evolved to specifically regulate different plasmid functions.IMPORTANCEConjugative plasmids play a crucial role in spreading antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Most natural conjugative plasmids conjugate only under specific conditions. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanisms underlying conjugation regulation is essential for understanding antimicrobial resistance and pathogen evolution. In this study, we characterized the conjugation regulation of the model IncX plasmid R6K. We discovered that Sfx, a H-NS homolog carried by the plasmid, represses conjugation. Molecular evolutionary analyses combined with gain-of-function experiments indicate that positive selection underlies the conjugation repression activity of Sfx. Additionally, we demonstrate that the loss of Sfx does not adversely affect R6K maintenance under laboratory conditions, suggesting additional selective forces favoring Sfx carriage.

Atg7 depletion in <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> resulted in the loss of Atg8 lipidation and multiple defects like clearance of micronemes, organelle biogenesis, and maturation of hepatic schizonts during liver-stage development. The essentiality of <i>Plasmodium</i> Atg7 in blood and liver stages suggests it is a prospective target for developing autophagy-specific inhibitors. These results highlight the importance of autophagy in malaria parasite development.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02735-24

The means by which <i>F. verticillioides</i> protects itself from its own mycotoxin are not completely understood. Some fumonisin (<i>FUM</i>) cluster genes do not contribute to the biosynthesis of the compound, but their function has remained enigmatic. Recently, we showed that <i>FUM17</i>, <i>FUM18,</i> and <i>FUM19</i> encode two ceramide synthases and an ATP-binding cassette transporter, respectively, which play a role in antagonizing the toxicity mediated by FB<sub>1</sub>. In the present work, we uncovered functions of two adjacent genes, <i>FUM15</i> and <i>FUM16</i>. Using homologous and heterologous expression systems, in <i>F. verticillioides</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, respectively, we provide evidence that both contribute to protection against FB<sub>1</sub>. Our data indicate a potential role for the P450 monooxygenase Fum15 in the modification and detoxification of FB<sub>1</sub> since the deletion and overexpression of the respective gene affected extracellular FB<sub>1</sub> levels in both hosts. Furthermore, relative quantification of ceramide intermediates and an <i>in vitro</i> enzyme assay revealed that Fum16 is a functional palmitoyl-CoA ligase. It co-localizes together with the ceramide synthase Fum18 to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they contribute to sphingolipid biosynthesis. Thereby, <i>FUM15-19</i> constitute a subcluster within the <i>FUM</i> biosynthetic gene cluster dedicated to the fungal self-protection against FB<sub>1</sub>.IMPORTANCEThe study identifies a five-gene <i>FUM</i> subcluster (<i>FUM15-19</i>) in <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> involved in self-protection against FB<sub>1</sub>. <i>FUM16</i> (palmitoyl-CoA ligase), <i>FUM17,</i> and <i>FUM18</i> (ceramide synthases) enzymatically supplement ceramide biosynthesis, while <i>FUM19</i> (ATP-binding cassette transporter) acts as a repressor of the <i>FUM</i> cluster.

Hence, beta-lactam resistance is a major health problem. Gene amplification of AmpC beta-lactamase is a main contributor to <i>de novo</i> β-lactam resistance in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. However, the time course of amplification and the accompanying DNA mutations are unclear. Here, we study the progression of <i>ampC</i> amplification and <i>ampC</i> promoter mutations during the evolution of resistance induced by stepwise increasing amoxicillin concentrations. <i>AmpC</i> promoter mutations occurred by day 2, while the approximately eight-fold amplification occurred after more than 6 days of amoxicillin exposure. The combination of the amplification and the promoter mutations increased the <i>ampC</i> mRNA level by an average factor of 200 after 22 days. An IS<i>1</i> insertion is identified in the amplification junction after resistance induction in the wild type (WT) and the <i>ampC</i> gene complementation strain (CompA), but not in ∆<i>ampC</i>, suggesting that the amplification depends on mobile genetic element transposition. In order to elucidate the correlation between gene mutations and <i>ampC</i> amplification, the DNA mutations acquired during resistance evolution by the WT, ∆<i>ampC</i>, and CompA were analyzed. Compared to evolved ∆<i>ampC</i>, several resistance-causing mutations are absent in evolved WT, while more mutations accumulated in stress response. The amoxicillin-resistant ∆<i>ampC</i> did not show amplification of the fragment around the original <i>ampC</i> position but exhibited a large duplication or triplication at another position, suggesting the essential role of the duplicated genes in resistance development.IMPORTANCEAmoxicillin is the most used antimicrobial against bacterial infections. DNA fragments containing <i>ampC</i> are amplified upon prolonged and stepwise increasing exposure to amoxicillin, causing resistance. These <i>ampC</i>-containing fragments have been identified in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase plasmids, which are considered the main cause of beta-lactam resistance. In this study, we document the time course of two important factors for <i>ampC</i> transcription enhancement, <i>ampC</i> amplification and <i>ampC</i> promoter mutations, during <i>de novo</i> amoxicillin resistance evolution. We propose that the transposon IS<i>1</i> contributes to the amplification <i>ampC</i> region, that the sigma factor 70 regulates <i>ampC</i> overexpression, and that these combined form the backbone of a putative mechanism for <i>ampC</i> amplification.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02982-24

Pathogens, including fungi, parasites, and bacteria, depend on UGP for the synthesis of virulence factors; in particular, various bacterial species utilize UDP-Glc and its derivatives for the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, and biofilm exopolysaccharides. UGPs have, therefore, gained attention as anti-bacterial drug target candidates, prompting us to study their structure-function relationships to provide a basis for the rational development of specific inhibitors. UGP function is tied to its oligomeric state, and the majority of bacterial homologs have been described as tetramers encoded by the <i>galU</i> gene. Uniquely, enterobacterial species harbor a second gene, <i>galF</i>, encoding a protein with high homology to UGP, whose function is somewhat controversial. Here, we show that the <i>galF</i> gene of the opportunistic pathogen <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> encodes a dimeric protein that has lost UGP activity, likely due to a combination of active site mutations and an inability to tetramerize, whereas the functional <i>K. pneumoniae</i> UGP, encoded by <i>galU</i>, is an active tetramer. Our AlphaFold-assisted structure-function relationship studies underline that tetramerization is essential for bacterial UGP function and is facilitated by a common mechanism utilizing conserved key residues. Targeting the respective molecular interfaces, which are absent in human UGP, could provide a means of selectively inhibiting the bacterial virulence factor UGP and potentially rendering pathogenic species avirulent.IMPORTANCEThe enzyme uridine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP) is important for the virulence of bacterial pathogens and, therefore, a potential drug target. In this study, we identify the gene encoding the functional UGP in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, a bacterium notoriously causing severe antibiotic-resistant infections in humans, and reveal structural and functional features that may aid in the development of new antibiotics.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02071-24

However, the regulatory network associated with T6SS in <i>A. baumannii</i> remains poorly understood. Here, we identified an Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of T6SS mediated by a bonafide small RNA, AbsR28. <i>A. baumannii</i> utilizes MumT, an Mn<sup>2+</sup>-uptake inner membrane transporter, for the uptake of extracellular Mn<sup>2+</sup> during oxidative stress. We demonstrate that the abundance of intracellular Mn<sup>2+</sup> enables complementary base pairing of AbsR28-<i>tssM</i> mRNA (that translates to TssM, one of the vital inner membrane components of T6SS), inducing RNase E-mediated degradation of <i>tssM</i> mRNA and resulting in T6SS repression. Thus, AbsR28 mediates a crosstalk between MumT and T6SS in <i>A. baumannii</i>.IMPORTANCESmall RNAs (sRNAs) are identified as critical components within the bacterial regulatory networks involved in fine regulation of virulence-associated factors. The sRNA-mediated regulation of type VI secretion system (T6SS) in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> was unchartered. Previously, it was demonstrated that <i>A. baumannii</i> ATCC 17978 cells switch from T6- to T6+ phenotype, resulting in the loss of antibiotic resistance conferred by plasmid pAB3. Furthermore, the derivatives of pAB3 found in recent clinical isolates of <i>A. baumannii</i> harbor expanded antibiotic resistance genes and multiple determinants for virulence factors. Hence, the loss of this plasmid for T6SS activity renders <i>A. baumannii</i> T6+ cells susceptible to antibiotics and compromises their virulence. Our findings show how <i>A. baumannii</i> tends to inactivate T6SS through an sRNA-mediated regulation that relies on Mn<sup>2+</sup> and retains pAB3 during infection to retain antibiotic resistance genes carried on the plasmid.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03025-24

Most phages are unsuitable for therapy because they are ""temperate"" and can integrate into the host genome, forming a lysogen that is protected from subsequent phage infections. However, integrated phages can be awakened by stressors such as antibiotics. Supported by this interaction, here we explore the potential use of combined temperate phage and antibiotic against the multi-drug-resistant pathogen, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. In all, thirty-nine temperate phages were isolated from clinical strains, and a subset was screened for synergy with six antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin, tobramycin, and polymyxin B), using checkerboard assays. Interestingly, our screen identified phages that can synergize with each antibiotic, despite their widely differing targets; however, these are highly phage-antibiotic and phage-host pairing specific. Screening across multiple clinical strains reveals that temperate phages can reduce the antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration up to 32-fold, even in a resistant isolate, functionally re-sensitizing the bacterium to the antibiotic. Meropenem and tobramycin did not reduce the frequency of lysogens, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of the temperate nature of the phages. By contrast, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin were able to reduce the frequency of lysogeny, the former by inducing phages-as previously reported in <i>E. coli</i>. Curiously, synergy with piperacillin reduced lysogen survivors, but not by inducing the phages, suggesting an alternative mechanism for biasing the phage lysis-lysogeny equilibrium. Overall, our findings indicate that temperate phages can act as adjuvants in clinically relevant pathogens, even in the presence of antibiotic resistance, thereby drastically expanding their therapeutic potential.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02559-24

TA systems have also been implicated in bacterial persistence and antibiotic tolerance, which can be precursors of antibiotic resistance. Here, we identified a clinical isolate of <i>Shigella sonnei</i> (CS14) with a remarkably stable pINV virulence plasmid; pINV is usually frequently lost from <i>S. sonnei</i>, but plasmid loss was not detected from CS14. We found that the plasmid in CS14 is stabilized by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in its <i>vapBC</i> TA system. VapBC TA systems are the most common Type II TA system in bacteria, and consist of a VapB antitoxin and VapC PIN domain-containing toxin. The plasmid stabilizing SNP leads to a Q12L substitution in the DNA-binding domain of VapB, which reduces VapBC binding to its own promoter, impairing <i>vapBC</i> autorepression. However, VapB<sup>L12</sup>C mediates high-level plasmid stabilization because VapB<sup>L12</sup> is more prone to degradation by Lon than wild-type VapB; this liberates VapC to efficiently kill bacteria that no longer contain a plasmid. Of note, mutations that confer tolerance to antibiotics in <i>Escherichia coli</i> also map to the DNA-binding domain of VapBC encoded by the chromosomally integrated F plasmid. We demonstrate that the tolerance mutations also enhance plasmid stabilization by the same mechanism as VapB<sup>L12</sup>. Our findings highlight the links between plasmid maintenance and antibiotic tolerance, both of which can promote the development of antimicrobial resistance.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02616-24

As the receptor-binding (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of HeV are essential for mediating viral entry, functional characterization of emerging HeV genotypic variants is key to understanding viral entry mechanisms and broader virus-host co-evolution. We first confirmed that HeV-g2 and HeV-g1 glycoproteins share a close phylogenetic relationship, underscoring HeV-g2's relevance to global health. Our <i>in vitro</i> data showed that HeV-g2 glycoproteins induced cell-cell fusion in human cells, shared receptor tropism with HeV-g1, and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against HeV-g1. Despite these similarities, HeV-g2 glycoproteins yielded reduced syncytia formation compared to HeV-g1. By expressing heterotypic combinations of HeV-g2, HeV-g1, and Nipah virus (NiV) glycoproteins, we found that while HeV-g2 G had strong fusion-promoting abilities, HeV-g2 F consistently displayed hypofusogenic properties. These fusion phenotypes were more closely associated with those observed in the related NiV. Further investigation using HeV-g1 and HeV-g2 glycoprotein chimeras revealed that multiple domains may play roles in modulating these fusion phenotypes. Altogether, our findings may establish intrinsic fusogenic capacities of viral glycoproteins as a potential driver behind the emergence of new henipaviral variants.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03482-23

This genome arrangement has led to a model where Pol II transcription of PTUs is unregulated and changes in gene expression are entirely post-transcriptional. <i>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</i> is unable to infect humans because of its susceptibility to an innate immune complex, trypanosome lytic factor (TLF) in the circulation of humans. The initial step in TLF-mediated lysis of <i>T.b.brucei</i> requires high affinity haptoglobin/hemoglobin receptor (HpHbR) binding. Here, we demonstrate that by <i>in vitro</i> selection with TLF, resistance is obtained in a stepwise process correlating with loss of HpHbR expression at an allelic level. RNA-seq, Pol II ChIP, and run-on analysis indicate HpHbR silencing is at the transcriptional level, where loss of Pol II binding at the promoter region specifically shuts down transcription of the HpHbR-containing gene cluster and the adjacent opposing gene cluster. Reversible transcriptional silencing of the divergent PTUs correlates with DNA base J modification of the shared promoter region. Base J function in establishing transcriptional silencing, rather than maintenance, is suggested by the maintenance of PTU silencing following the inhibition of J-biosynthesis and subsequent loss of the modified DNA base. Therefore, we show that epigenetic mechanisms exist to regulate gene expression via Pol II transcription initiation of gene clusters in a mono-allelic fashion. These findings suggest epigenetic chromatin-based regulation of gene expression is deeply conserved among eukaryotes, including early divergent eukaryotes that rely on polycistronic transcription.IMPORTANCEThe single-cell parasite <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> causes lethal diseases in both humans and livestock. <i>T. brucei</i> undergoes multiple developmental changes to adapt in different environments during its digenetic life cycle. With protein-coding genes organized as polycistronic transcription and apparent absence of promoter-mediated regulation of transcription initiation, it is believed that developmental gene regulation in trypanosomes is essentially post-transcriptional. In this study, we found reversible Pol II transcriptional silencing of two adjacent polycistronic gene arrays that correlate with the novel DNA base J modification of the shared promoter region. Our findings support epigenetic regulation of Pol II transcription initiation as a viable mechanism of gene expression control in <i>T. brucei</i>. This has implications for our understanding how trypanosomes utilize polycistronic genome organization to regulate gene expression during its life cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02328-24

However, transformation efficiencies have a direct correlation with the probability of introducing multiple DNA molecules into each cell, although reliable library screenings require cells that contain a single unique genotype. Thus, transformation methods that yield a high multiplicity of transformations are unsuitable for high-diversity library screenings. Here, we describe an innovative yeast library transformation method that is both simple and highly efficient. Our dual heat-shock and electroporation approach (HEEL) creates high-quality DNA libraries by increasing the fraction of mono-transformed yeast cells from 20% to over 70% of all transformed cells, thus allowing for near-perfect phenotype-to-genotype associations. HEEL also allows more than 10<sup>7</sup> yeast cells per reaction to be transformed with a circular plasmid molecule, which corresponds to an almost 100-fold improvement compared with current yeast transformation methods. To further refine our library screening approach, we integrated an automated yeast genotyping workflow with a dual-barcode design that employs both a single nucleotide polymorphism and a high-diversity region. This design allows for robust identification and quantification of unique genotypes within a heterogeneous population using standard Sanger sequencing. Our findings demonstrate that the longstanding trade-off between the size and quality of transformed yeast libraries can be overcome. By employing the HEEL method, large DNA libraries can be transformed into yeast with high-efficiency, while maintaining high library quality, essential for successful mutant screenings. This advancement holds significant promise for the fields of molecular biology and protein engineering.IMPORTANCEWith the recent expansion of artificial intelligence in the field of synthetic biology, there has never been a greater need for high-quality data and reliable measurements of phenotype-to-genotype relationships. However, one major obstacle to creating accurate computer-based models is the current abundance of low-quality phenotypic measurements originating from numerous high-throughput but low-resolution assays. Rather than increasing the quantity of measurements, new studies should aim to generate as accurate measurements as possible. The HEEL methodology presented here aims to address this issue by minimizing the problem of multi-plasmid uptake during high-throughput yeast DNA transformations, which leads to the creation of heterogeneous cellular genotypes. HEEL should enable highly accurate phenotype-to-genotype measurements going forward, which could be used to construct better computer-based models.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03197-24

We hypothesized that gene therapy platforms could be useful in these cases if the production of an anti-inflammatory protein reflects the intensity and duration of the inflammatory condition. The recombinant protein would be produced and released only in the presence of the inciting stimulus, avoiding immunosuppression or other unwanted side effects that may occur when treating infectious diseases with anti-inflammatory drugs.

Infection by alphaviruses including CHIKV and the closely related Semliki Forest virus (SFV) can induce the formation of filopodia-like intercellular long extensions (ILEs). ILEs emanate from an infected cell, stably attach to a neighboring cell, and mediate cell-to-cell viral transmission that is resistant to neutralizing antibodies. However, our mechanistic understanding of ILE formation is limited, and the potential contribution of ILEs to CHIKV virulence or human CHIKV infection is unknown. Here, we used well-characterized virus mutants and monoclonal antibodies with known epitopes to dissect the virus requirements for ILE formation. Our results showed that both the viral E2 and E1 envelope proteins were required for ILE formation, while viral proteins 6K and transframe, and cytoplasmic nucleocapsid formation were dispensable. A subset of CHIKV monoclonal antibodies reduced ILE formation by masking specific regions particularly on the E2 A domain.

Archaea of the order Sulfolobales divide using a simpler version of the eukaryotic endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, composed of three ESCRT-III homologs (ESCRT-III, -III-1, and -III-2), AAA+ ATPase Vps4 and an archaea-specific component CdvA. Here, we clarify how these components act sequentially to drive the division of the hyperthermophilic archaeon <i>Saccharolobus islandicus</i>. Our data suggest that ESCRT-III plays an active role during the early stage of membrane constriction during cytokinesis, whereas ESCRT-III-1 and ESCRT-III-2 are indispensable for the ""pre-late"" and ""late"" stages of cytokinesis, respectively. In the <i>escrt-III-1</i> deletion strain, the division is blocked when the mid-cell constriction reaches ~30% of the initial cell diameter (""pre-late"" stage), yielding ""chain-like"" cellular aggregates. Depletion of ESCRT-III-2 leads to the accumulation of cells connected through narrow membrane bridges (""late"" stage), consistent with the key role of this protein in the final membrane abscission. We used 3D-single molecule localization microscopy to image ESCRT-III rings of different diameters and show that the decrease in the ESCRT-III ring diameter and membrane constriction are inconsistent with a mechanism exclusively based on spiraling of the ESCRT-III filaments. By contrast, the cone-shaped assemblies of ESCRT-III-1 and ESCRT-III-2 are consistent with spiral formation, highlighting the distinct roles of the three ESCRT-III proteins during the cytokinesis.

Competence-mediated bacteriocin expression by <i>S. pneumoniae</i> plays a major role in both the establishment and persistence of colonization on this polymicrobial surface. Over 20 distinct bacteriocin loci have been identified in pneumococcal genomes, but only a small number have been characterized phenotypically. In this work, we demonstrate that three-fourths of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> strains contain a highly conserved <i>scb</i> locus that encodes an active lactococcin 972-like bacteriocin called streptococcin B. In these backgrounds, the <i>scbABC</i> locus is part of the early competence cascade due to a ComE binding site in the promoter region. Streptococcin B producing strains target both members of the population that have failed to activate competence and the 25% of the population that carry a naturally occurring deletion of the ComE binding site and the functional bacteriocin gene. The ComR-type regulator found directly upstream of the <i>scb</i> locus in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> strains can activate <i>scb</i> expression independent of the presence of the ComE binding site but only when stimulated by a peptide that is encoded in the <i>scb</i> locus of <i>Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae</i>, a closely related bacterium that also inhabits the human nasopharynx. Given the co-regulation with competence and the phenotypic confirmation of activity, streptococcin B represents a previously unrecognized fratricide effector that gives producing strains an additional advantage over the naturally occurring deleted strains during colonization.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02993-24

Interestingly, E6AP not only aids in the E6-directed degradation of cellular substrates but also stabilizes the E6 protein by protecting it from proteasome-mediated degradation. However, there is no information available about the ubiquitin ligases that regulate the stability and activity of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein in the absence of E6AP. Therefore, to identify these novel ubiquitin ligases, we performed high-throughput human siRNA library screen against ubiquitin ligases in clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-edited E6AP-knockout human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HPV-18E6. We found a number of ubiquitin ligases that increase the expression of GFP-tagged 18E6 upon their knockdown in the absence of E6AP. Upon validation of the interaction of 18E6 with these ubiquitin ligases in cervical cancer-derived cell lines, we found that the knockdown of ubiquitin ligase F-box protein 4 (FBXO4), together with E6AP knockdown, leads to a dramatic increase in the levels of endogenous HPV-18E6 oncoprotein. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the combined knockdown of FBXO4 and E6AP not only rescues the protein levels of E6 but also induces high levels of cell death in a p53-dependent manner in the HPV-positive cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. These results indicate a close interplay between FBXO4, E6AP, and p53 in the regulation of cell survival in HPV-positive cervical tumor-derived cells.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02783-24

The GAS M1<sub>UK</sub> lineage has contributed significantly to the recently reported increases in scarlet fever and invasive infections. However, the basis for its evolutionary success is not yet fully understood. During the transition to systemic disease, the M1 serotype is known to give rise to spontaneous mutations in the control of virulence two-component regulatory system (CovRS) that confer a fitness advantage during invasive infections. Mutations that inactivate CovS function result in the de-repression of key GAS virulence factors such as streptolysin O (SLO), a pore-forming toxin and major trigger of inflammasome/interleukin-1β-dependent inflammation. Conversely, expression of the streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB, which is required during initial stages of colonization and onset of invasive disease, is typically lost in such mutants. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel <i>covS</i> single nucleotide polymorphism detected in three separate invasive M1<sub>UK</sub> isolates. The resulting CovS<sup>Ala318Val</sup> mutation caused a significant upregulation of SLO resulting in increased inflammasome activation in human THP-1 macrophages, indicating an enhanced inflammatory potential. Surprisingly, SpeB production was unaffected. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to assess the impact of this mutation on virulence and global gene expression. We found that the CovS<sup>Ala318Val</sup> mutation led to subtle, virulence-specific changes of the CovRS regulon compared to previously characterized <i>covS</i> mutations, highlighting an unappreciated level of complexity in CovRS-dependent gene regulation. Continued longitudinal surveillance is warranted to determine whether this novel <i>covS</i> mutation will expand in the M1<sub>UK</sub> lineage.IMPORTANCEThe M1<sub>UK</sub> lineage of GAS has contributed to a recent global upsurge in scarlet fever and invasive infections. Understanding how GAS can become more virulent is critical for infection control and identifying new treatment approaches. The two-component CovRS system, comprising the sensor kinase CovS and transcription factor CovR, is a central regulator of GAS virulence genes. In the M1 serotype, <i>covRS</i> mutations are associated with an invasive phenotype. Such mutations have not been fully characterized in the M1<sub>UK</sub> lineage. This study identified a novel <i>covS</i> mutation in invasive Australian M1<sub>UK</sub> isolates that resulted in a more nuanced virulence gene regulation compared to previously characterized <i>covS</i> mutations. A representative isolate displayed upregulated SLO production and triggered amplified interleukin-1β secretion in infected human macrophages, indicating an enhanced inflammatory potential. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive analyses of <i>covRS</i> mutants to fully elucidate their contribution to M1<sub>UK</sub> virulence and persistence.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03366-24

While communication via quorum sensing, or by the release and uptake of extracellular vesicles, is widespread in nature, the phenomenon of flagellar fusion has only been observed in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. We showed previously that a small proportion of procyclic culture forms (corresponding to insect midgut forms) can fuse their flagella and exchange cytosolic and membrane proteins. This happens reproducibly in cell culture. It was not known, however, if flagellar fusion also occurs in the tsetse fly host, and at what stage of the life cycle. We have developed a split-Cre-Lox system to permanently label trypanosomes that undergo flagellar fusion. Specifically, we engineered trypanosomes to contain a GFP gene flanked by Lox sites in the reverse orientation to the promoter. In addition, the cells expressed inactive halves of the Cre recombinase, either N-terminal Cre residues 1-244 (N-Cre) or C-terminal Cre residues 245-343 (C-Cre). Upon flagellar fusion, these Cre halves were exchanged between trypanosomes, forming functional full Cre and flipping reverse-GFP into its forward orientation. We showed that cells that acquired the second half Cre through flagellar fusion were permanently modified and that the cells and their progeny constitutively expressed GFP. When tsetse flies were co-infected with N-Cre and C-Cre cells, GFP-positive trypanosomes were observed in the midgut and proventriculus 28-34 days post-infection. These results show that flagellar fusion not only happens in culture but also during the natural life cycle of trypanosomes in their tsetse fly host.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03375-24

This large DNA virus encodes more than 150 open reading frames, many of which are uncharacterized. The <i>EP402R</i> gene encodes CD2v, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of infected cells and the only viral protein known to be present in the virus external envelope. This protein mediates binding of erythrocytes to both cells and virions. This interaction is known to prolong virus persistence in blood thus facilitating viral transmission. The sequence of the extracellular domain of CD2v shows similarity with that of mammalian CD2 proteins and is therefore likely to feature two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. A combination of protein structure modeling and extensive mutagenesis was used to identify residues mediating binding of transiently expressed CD2v to erythrocytes. The N-terminal Ig-like domain AGFCC'C″ β sheet was identified as the putative CD2v erythrocyte-binding area. This region differed from the putative CD58 ligand binding site of host CD2, suggesting that CD2v may bind to a ligand(s) other than CD58. An attenuated genotype I ASFV was constructed by replacing the wild-type <i>EP402R</i> gene for a mutant form expressing CD2v bearing a single amino acid substitution, which abrogated the binding to erythrocytes. Pigs immunized with the recombinant virus developed early antibody and cellular responses, low levels of viremia, mild clinical signs post-immunization, and high levels of protection against challenge. These findings improve our understanding of virus-host interactions and provide a promising approach to modified live vaccine development.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01655-24

Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing biofilm formation is crucial for developing anti-biofilm therapies. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen to identify novel genes that regulate biofilm formation in <i>C. albicans</i>. One identified gene is <i>ORF19.6693</i>, a homolog of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDD3</i> gene. The <i>sdd3</i>∆/∆ mutant exhibited severe defects in biofilm formation and significantly reduced chitin content in the cell wall. Overexpression of the constitutively active version of the Rho1 GTPase Rho1<sup>G18V</sup>, an upstream activator of the protein kinase C (PKC)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cell-wall integrity pathway, rescued these defects. Affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed Sdd3's physical interaction with Bem2, the GTPase-activating protein of Rho1. Deletion of <i>SDD3</i> significantly reduced the amount of the active GTP-bound form of Rho1, thereby diminishing PKC-MAPK signaling and downregulating chitin synthase genes <i>CHS2</i> and <i>CHS8</i>. Taken together, our studies identify a new biofilm regulator, Sdd3, in <i>C. albicans</i> that modulates Rho1 activity through its inhibitory interaction with Bem2, thereby regulating the PKC-MAPK pathway to control chitin biosynthesis, which is critical for biofilm formation. As an upstream component of the pathway and lacking a homolog in mammals, Sdd3 has the potential to serve as an antifungal target for biofilm infections.IMPORTANCEThe human fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> is categorized as a critical priority pathogen on the World Health Organization's Fungal Priority Pathogens List. A key virulence attribute of this pathogen is its ability to form biofilms on the surfaces of indwelling medical devices. Fungal cells in biofilms are highly resistant to antifungal drugs and host immunity, leading to treatment failure. This study conducted a genetic screen to discover novel genes that regulate biofilm formation. We found that deletion of the <i>SDD3</i> gene caused severe biofilm defects. Sdd3 negatively regulates the Rho1 GTPase, an upstream activator of the protein kinase C-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, through direct interaction with Bem2, the GTPase-activating protein of Rho1, resulting in a significant decrease in chitin content in the fungal cell wall. This chitin synthesis defect leads to biofilm formation failure. Given its essential role in biofilm formation, Sdd3 could serve as an antifungal target for biofilm infections.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03283-24

LarB, LarC, and LarE are responsible for NPN synthesis, with the cofactor subsequently installed into LarA homologs. Hurdles for investigating the functional properties of such proteins arise from the difficulty of obtaining the active, NPN cofactor-loaded enzymes and in assaying their diverse reactivities. Here, we show that when the <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum lar</i> genes are cloned into the Duet expression system and cultured in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, they confer lactate racemase activity to the cells. By replacing <i>L. plantarum larA</i> with related genes from other microorganisms, this system allows for the generation of active LarA homologs. Furthermore, the Duet system enables the functional testing of LarB, LarC, and LarE homologs from other microorganisms. In addition to applying the Duet expression system for synthesis of active, NPN cofactor-containing enzymes in <i>E. coli</i>, we demonstrate that circular dichroism spectroscopy provides a broadly applicable means of assaying these enzymes. By selecting a wavelength of high molar ellipticity and low absorbance for a given 2-hydroxy acid substrate enantiomer, the conversion of one enantiomer/epimer into the other can be monitored for LarA homologs without the need for any coupling enzymes or reagents.

Recent studies have indicated that novel H10N3 viruses are highly pathogenic in mice and can be transmitted between guinea pigs via respiratory droplets without prior adaptation. However, the biological characteristics of novel H10N3 in poultry have not been fully elucidated. Our findings revealed that H10 subtype AIVs are predominantly prevalent in waterfowl. Notably, H10N8 and H10N3 viruses that have infected humans were primarily isolated from chickens. For the first time, double basic hemagglutinin cleavage sites (motif PEIKQGR↓GL) were identified in novel H10N3 AIVs, which exhibit enhanced replication in chickens, and can be transmitted between chickens through direct contact and respiratory droplets. Animal experimental studies demonstrated that ducks are also susceptible to H10N3 viruses and that the virus is transmissible through direct contact, suggesting a greater risk of transmission and recombination. Serological studies conducted among poultry workers suggest that while the human population was largely naïve to H10N3 infection, sporadic and undetected human infections did occur, indicating a potential increasing trend. These data further emphasize the growing threat to public health posed by zoonotic H10N3 subtype AIVs.IMPORTANCEExposure to poultry in live poultry markets (LPMs) is strongly associated with human infection with avian influenza viruses (AIVs), with chickens being the most common species found in these markets in China. The prevalence of AIVs in chickens, therefore, increases the risk of human infection. Notably, the main host of the novel H10N3 virus has shifted from waterfowl to chickens, and the virus can be transmitted between chickens via respiratory droplets, posing a potential risk of a pandemic within poultry populations. The novel H10N3 virus also remains sensitive to ducks and can be transmitted through direct contact, which means a greater risk of transmission and recombination. Significantly, the human population remains largely naïve to H10N3 infection, but sporadic seropositivity among poultry workers indicates previous exposure to H10 subtype AIVs. Therefore, a comprehensive surveillance of the novel H10N3 viruses in poultry is imperative. Effective control of the virus within poultry populations could significantly reduce the risk of emerging human infections.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02363-24

It has four paralogous genes encoding sphingolipid synthases (<i>TbSLS1-4</i>). TbSLS1 is a dedicated IPC synthase, TbSLS2 is a dedicated EPC synthase, and TbSLS3 and TbSLS4 are bifunctional SM/EPC synthases. IPC synthesis occurs exclusively in the procyclic insect stage (PCF), EPC is limited to the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF), and SM is synthesized throughout the life cycle. TbSLSs are indispensable for the viability of BSF and are, thus, potential drug targets. The relative stage-specific expression of each <i>TbSLS</i> paralog was compared, and the results match phosphosphingolipid content. Induction of pan-specific RNAi silencing was lethal in both BSF and PCF. To investigate individual TbSLS functions, separate HA-tagged genes, recoded to be RNAi-resistant (RNAi<sup>R</sup>), were engineered to replace a single allele of the entire <i>TbSLS</i> locus within parental BSF and PCF RNAi cell lines. RNAi<sup>R</sup> <i>TbSLS3</i> and <i>TbSLS4</i> both rescued BSF growth under silencing. Expression of RNAi<sup>R</sup> <i>TbSLS1</i>, normally repressed in BSF, did not rescue BSF viability but was not detrimental to normal <i>in vitro</i> growth. RNAi<sup>R</sup> <i>TbSLS1</i>, <i>TbSLS3</i>, and <i>TbSLS4</i> were each sufficient to rescue PCF growth, indicating IPC is not essential for PCF viability <i>in vitro</i>. All TbSLSs localize to distal Golgi compartments in both BSF and PCF cells. These findings raise interesting questions about the roles of individual phosphosphingolipids in <i>in vivo</i> infection of the mammalian and tsetse hosts.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03501-24

However, most intracellular bacterial pathogens are restricted in neutrophils, which are the first line of innate immune defense against invading pathogens. Bacterial degradation within neutrophils is mediated by the fusion of microbicidal granules to pathogen-containing phagosomes and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex. Here, we show that human neutrophils fail to trigger microbicidal processes and, consequently, fail to restrict <i>L. longbeachae</i>. In addition, neutrophils infected with <i>L. longbeachae</i> fail to undergo a robust pro-inflammatory response, such as degranulation and IL-8 production. Here, we identify three strategies employed by <i>L. longbeachae</i> for evading restriction by neutrophils and inhibiting the neutrophil microbicidal response to other bacteria co-inhabiting in the same cell. First, <i>L. longbeachae</i> excludes the cytosolic and membrane-bound subunits of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex from its phagosomal membrane independent of the type 4 secretion system (T4SS). Consequently, infected neutrophils fail to generate robust ROS in response to <i>L. longbeachae</i>. Second, <i>L. longbeachae</i> impedes the fusion of azurophilic granules to its phagosome and the phagosomes of bacteria co-inhabiting the same cell through T4SS-independent mechanisms. Third, <i>L. longbeachae</i> protects phagosomes of co-inhabiting bacteria from degradation by ROS through a <i>trans</i>-acting T4SS-dependent mechanism. Collectively, we conclude that <i>L. longbeachae</i> evades restriction by human neutrophils <i>via</i> T4SS-independent mechanisms and utilizes <i>trans</i>-acting T4SS-dependent mechanisms for inhibition of neutrophil ROS generation throughout the cell cytosol.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03274-24

In proof-of-principle experiments, we induced functional knockdown of IncA, a fusion-mediating inclusion membrane protein, as shown with Western blots, loss of IncA staining at the inclusion membrane, and production of multiple chlamydial inclusions within an infected cell. These effects were titratable and reversible. To test for polar effects, we separately targeted the inclusion membrane proteins IncE and IncG, which are expressed from the <i>incDEFG</i> operon. Knockdown of IncE caused loss of IncE and its interacting host protein SNX6 at the inclusion membrane, without affecting IncG protein levels. Similarly, IncG knockdown significantly reduced IncG levels and prevented recruitment of its interacting host protein 14-3-3β, without altering IncE protein levels. These data provide the first genetic evidence that IncE and IncG are necessary for the recruitment of SNX6 and 14-3-3β, respectively, demonstrating the value of this knockdown approach. We also successfully depleted the major chlamydial surface protein, major outer membrane protein (MOMP), which is encoded by a likely essential gene that has not been previously disrupted or knocked down. MOMP knockdown caused severe defects in bacterial morphology and progeny production. Thus, our sRNA-based approach has broad potential as a conditional knockdown method for studying the function of <i>C. trachomatis</i> genes, including essential genes and genes in an operon.IMPORTANCEWe describe a new method to reduce protein levels of a selected gene in the pathogenic bacterium <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>.

NDMs have been exceptionally characterized as lipoproteins anchored to the outer membrane. A bioinformatics study on all sequenced β-lactamases was performed that revealed a predominance of putative lipidated enzymes in the Class D OXAs. Namely, 60% of the OXA Class D enzymes contain a lipobox sequence in their signal peptide, that is expected to trigger lipidation and membrane anchoring. This contrasts with β-lactamases from other classes, which are predicted to be mostly soluble proteins. Almost all (>99%) putative lipidated OXAs are present in <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. Importantly, we further demonstrate that OXA-23 and OXA-24/40 are lipidated, membrane-bound proteins in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. In contrast, OXA-48 (commonly produced by Enterobacterales) lacks a lipobox and is a soluble protein. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from <i>A. baumannii</i> cells expressing OXA-23 and OXA-24/40 contain these enzymes in their active form. Moreover, OXA-loaded OMVs were able to protect <i>A. baumannii</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> cells susceptible to piperacillin and imipenem. These results permit us to conclude that membrane binding is a bacterial host-specific phenomenon in OXA enzymes. These findings reveal that membrane-bound β-lactamases are more common than expected and support the hypothesis that OMVs loaded with lipidated β-lactamases are vehicles for antimicrobial resistance and its dissemination. This advantage could be crucial in polymicrobial infections, in which <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. are usually involved, and underscore the relevance of identifying the cellular localization of lactamases to better understand their physiology and target them.IMPORTANCEβ-lactamases represent the main mechanism of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Their catalytic function (cleaving β-lactam antibiotics) occurs in the bacterial periplasm, where they are commonly reported as soluble proteins. A bioinformatic analysis reveals a significant number of putative lipidated β-lactamases, expected to be attached to the outer bacterial membrane. Notably, 60% of Class D OXA β-lactamases (all from <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp.) are predicted as membrane-anchored proteins. We demonstrate that two clinically relevant carbapenemases, OXA-23 and OXA-24/40, are membrane-bound proteins in <i>A. baumannii</i>. This cellular localization favors the secretion of these enzymes into outer membrane vesicles that transport them outside the boundaries of the cell. β-lactamase-loaded vesicles can protect populations of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, enabling them to thrive in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics. The ubiquity of this phenomenon suggests that it may have influenced the dissemination of resistance mediated by <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp., particularly in polymicrobial infections, being a potent evolutionary advantage.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03343-24

We studied the role of Hog1/p38 in reprogramming translation during thermal stress adaptation and found that this pathway acts on translation <i>via</i> crosstalk with the Gcn2 pathway, a well-studied regulator of general translation control. Using a combination of molecular assays and phenotypic analysis, we show that increased output from the Gcn2 pathway in a Hog1 deletion mutant is associated with rescue of thermal stress adaptation at both molecular and phenotypic scales. We characterize known outputs of the Hog1 pathway during thermal stress as either Gcn2-dependent or Gcn2-independent and demonstrate that Hog1 activation regulates the Gcn2 pathway even in the absence of thermal stress. Finally, we implicate this phenomenon in another Hog1-regulated process, morphogenesis, and recapitulate Hog1-Gcn2 crosstalk in the distantly related fungal pathogen, <i>Candida albicans</i>. Our results point to an important link between the stress response machinery and translation control and clarify the etiology of phenotypes associated with Hog1 deletion. More broadly, this study highlights complex interplay between core conserved signal transduction pathways and the utility of molecular assays to better understand how these pathways are connected.IMPORTANCE<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an opportunistic pathogen of humans that causes deadly cryptococcal meningitis, which is is responsible for an estimated 19% of AIDS-related mortality. When left untreated, cryptococcal meningitis is uniformly fatal, and in patients receiving the most effective antifungal regimens, mortality remains high. Thus, there is a critical need to identify additional targets that play a role in the adaptation to the human host and virulence. This study explores the role of the stress response kinases Hog1 and Gcn2 in thermoadaptation, which is a pre-requisite for virulence. Our results show that compensatory signaling occurs <i>via</i> the Gcn2 pathway when Hog1 is deleted, and that disruption of both pathways increases sensitivity to thermal stress. Importantly, our study highlights the insufficiency of using single-gene deletion mutants to study gene function, since many phenotypes associated with Hog1 deletion were driven by Gcn2 signaling in this background, rather than loss of direct Hog1 activity.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01762-24

The <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> BumSR TCS is unusual in that the BumS sensor exclusively functions as a phosphatase rather than a kinase to control phosphorylated levels of its cognate BumR response regulator (P-BumR). We previously found that BumSR directs a response to the short-chain fatty acid butyrate generated by resident microbiota so that <i>C. jejuni</i> identifies ideal lower intestinal niches in avian and human hosts for colonization. However, butyrate is an indirect cue for BumS and did not inhibit <i>in vitro</i> BumS phosphatase activity for P-BumR. In this work, we expanded the repertoire of lower intestinal metabolites that are cues sensed by BumS that modulate the expression of genes required for colonization to include the branched short-chain fatty acids isobutyrate and isovalerate. Unlike butyrate, isobutyrate and isovalerate inhibited <i>in vitro</i> BumS phosphatase activity for P-BumR, indicating that these metabolites are direct cues for BumS. Isobutyrate and isovalerate reduced the thermostability of BumS and caused a reorganization of protein structure to suggest how sensing these cues inhibits phosphatase activity. We also identified residues in the BumS sensory domain required to detect isobutyrate, isovalerate, and butyrate and for optimal colonization of hosts to reveal how gut bacteria can recognize these intestinal metabolites. Our work reveals how this unusual bacterial sensor phosphatase senses a repertoire of intestinal metabolites and how cues alter BumSR signal transduction to influence <i>C. jejuni</i> colonization of hosts.IMPORTANCETCSs are prevalent in many bacteria, but the cues sensed by each are not actually known for many of these systems. Microbiota-generated butyrate in human and avian hosts is detected by the <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> BumS sensor phosphatase so that the bacterium identifies ideal lower intestinal niches for colonization. However, BumS only indirectly senses butyrate to inhibit dephosphorylation of its cognate BumR response regulator. Here, we expanded the repertoire of cues sensed by BumS to the branched-short chain fatty acids isobutyrate and isovalerate that are also abundant in the lower intestines. Both isobutyrate and isovalerate are potent, direct cues for BumS, whereas butyrate is an indirect cue. Leveraging isobutyrate and isovalerate as direct cues, we reveal BumS structure is altered upon cue detection to inhibit its phosphatase activity. We provide an understanding of the mechanics of an unusual mode of signal transduction executed by BumSR and other bacterial sensor phosphatase-driven TCSs.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03278-24
{'mBio'},"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '04'}",MeJA inhibits fungal growth and DON toxin production by interfering with the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in the wheat scab fungus <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>.,"Deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin primarily produced by <i>Fusarium</i> species, is commonly found in cereal grains and poses risks to human and animal health, as well as global grain trade. This study demonstrates that methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a natural plant hormone, inhibits the growth and conidiation of <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. Importantly, MeJA significantly reduces DON production by suppressing <i>TRI</i> gene expression and toxisome formation. To explore the molecular mechanism, we identified MeJA-tolerant mutants, including a transcription factor <i>MRT1</i> and cAMP-PKA pathway-related genes (<i>FgGPA1</i> and <i>FgSNT1</i>). MeJA treatment reduced PKA activity and intracellular cAMP levels in <i>F. graminearum</i>, suggesting it targets the cAMP-PKA pathway. Notably, the MeJA-resistant mutant <i>FgGPA1</i><sup>R178H</sup> enhanced fungal growth, DON production, and cAMP levels in the presence of MeJA. Exogenous cAMP alleviated MeJA's inhibitory effects on DON production, further supporting this pathway's involvement. Interestingly, MeJA had no effect on all three MAP kinase pathways (Mgv1, Gpmk1, and FgHog1). Truncated and phospho-mimicking mutations in Mrt1 or FgSnt1 conferred MeJA resistance, suggesting they may act downstream of the cAMP-PKA pathway. In conclusion, MeJA presents a promising approach to control <i>F. graminearum</i> growth and DON production.IMPORTANCEDeoxynivalenol (DON) poses significant risks to both human and animal health and severely disrupts the global grain trade due to its prevalence as a common contaminant in wheat grains. With rising public concern over food safety, finding effective and sustainable methods to reduce DON contamination becomes increasingly urgent. In our study, we found that methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a natural plant hormone, can effectively inhibit the vegetative growth of <i>F. graminearum</i> and significantly reduce its DON toxin production. To explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we identified the mutations in MeJA-tolerant mutants and revealed that MeJA effectively exerts its antifungal activities by inhibiting the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in <i>F. graminearum</i>. Our work provides a promising natural solution to reduce DON toxin contamination in cereal grains, enhancing food safety while decreasing the reliance on chemical fungicides and their associated environmental impact.",https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03151-24
