{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-17,Correlating phylogenetic and functional diversity of the nod-free but nodulating Bradyrhizobium phylogroup.,"Bradyrhizobium is a main rhizobial lineage of which most members nodulate legume plants using Nod factors synthetized by the nod genes. However, members of the Photosynthetic supergroup (phylogroup) within Bradyrhizobium are nod-free, but still capable of establishing nitrogen-fixing nodules with some tropical legumes of the Aeschynomene genus. These unusual findings are based on the genomic sequences of only 13 Photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium strains, and almost all were isolated from Aeschynomene nodules. Here, we report that Photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium supergroup members are more abundantly associated with rice root (endosphere and rhizosphere) compared to grassland, forest, and maize samples based on rpoB amplicon sequence analyses. We sequenced 263 new isolates of this supergroup mostly from two main subspecies of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L. spp. indica and japonica). The extended supergroup comprises three major clades with their diversity broadly covering the natural community of this supergroup: a basal clade with significant expansion of its diversity, a clade composed by two phylogenetically diverse strains including one newly isolated, and a new clade exclusively represented by our new strains. Although this supergroup members universally lack the canonical nod genes, all 28 assayed strains covering the broad diversity induced nodules on Aeschynomene indica. The three clades displayed important differences in the efficiency of symbiosis, aligning well with their phylogenetic divergence. With this expanded ecological, phylogenetic, and functional diversity, we conclude that the nod factor-independent nodulation of Aeschynomene is a common trait of this supergroup, in contrast to the photosynthetic trait originally thought of as its unifying feature.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf030
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-17,Murine gut microbial interactions exert anti-hyperglycemic effects.,"The correlations between gut microbiota and host metabolism had been studied extensively, whereas little relevant work had been done to investigate the impact of gut microbial interactions on host metabolism. Assisted with bacteriocin-targeting strategy, we aimed to identify the glucose and lipid metabolism-associated gut microbes by adjusting the gut microbial composition of high-fat diet-fed mice. To fulfill this goal, the Listeria monocytogenes-derived bacteriocin Lmo2776 secretion module was constructed and integrated into the genome of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, yielding the Lmo2776-secreting strain EcN-2776. EcN-2776 administration decreased the blood glucose and increased the serum triglyceride of high-fat diet-fed mice. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicated that intestinal secretion of Lmo2776 adjusted the gut microbial composition of high-fat diet-fed mice. Specifically, Lmo2776 restricted the growth of Ligilactobacillus murinus, thus alleviating its inhibitory impact towards Faecalibaculum rodentium. Further analyses indicated that Faecalibaculum rodentium administration decreased the fasting blood glucose of high-fat diet-fed mice, which might be achieved by the intestinal consumption of glucose by Faecalibaculum rodentium. Our study identified the glucose metabolism-associated gut microbes, uncovered their interactions, deciphered the impact of gut microbial interaction on host glucose metabolism, and paved the way for treating hyperglycemia from the perspective of gut microbial interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf028
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-17,Microbial ecology of Serpentinite-hosted ecosystems.,"Serpentinization, the collective set of geochemical reactions initiated by the hydration of ultramafic rock, has occurred throughout Earth history and is inferred to occur on several planets and moons in our solar system. These reactions generate highly reducing conditions that can drive organic synthesis reactions potentially conducive to the emergence of life, while concomitantly generating fluids that challenge life owing to hyperalkalinity and limited inorganic carbon (and oxidant) availability. Consequently, the serpentinite-hosted biosphere offers insights into the earliest life, the habitable limits for life, and the potential for life on other planets. However, the support of abundant microbial communities by serpentinites was only recognized ~20 years ago with the discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents emanating serpentinized fluids. Here, we review the microbial ecology of both marine and continental serpentinization-influenced ecosystems in conjunction with a comparison of publicly available metagenomic sequence data from these communities to provide a global perspective of serpentinite microbial ecology. Synthesis of observations across global systems reveal consistent themes in the diversity, ecology, and functioning of communities. Nevertheless, individual systems exhibit nuances due to local geology, hydrology, and input of oxidized, near-surface/seawater fluids. Further, several new (and old) questions remain including the provenance of carbon to support biomass synthesis, the physical and chemical limits of life in serpentinites, the mode and tempo of in situ evolution, and the extent that modern serpentinites serve as analogs for those on early Earth. These topics are explored from a microbial perspective to outline key knowledge-gaps for future research.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf029
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-12,Targeted prebiotic application of gluconic acid-containing oligosaccharides promotes Faecalibacterium growth through microbial cross-feeding networks.,"The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, and certain bacterial species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, are particularly beneficial. This study conducted a comprehensive investigation of prebiotic compounds that showed potential for specifically promoting beneficial gut bacteria. Using in vitro fecal cultures and a human intervention study, we identified maltobionic acid and lactobionic acid as compounds that specifically promoted Faecalibacterium growth both in vitro and in vivo without significantly affecting Bifidobacterium, which is typically increased by traditional prebiotics. In a human intervention study (n = 27), a significant increase was observed in Faecalibacterium abundance following maltobionic acid supplementation, with effectiveness correlating with the initial Parabacteroides abundance. Mechanistic investigations revealed a cross-feeding pathway between gut bacteria. In this pathway, Parabacteroides species converted the gluconic acid moiety of maltobionic and lactobionic acids to glucuronic acid, which was then preferentially utilized by Faecalibacterium. These findings suggest that gluconic acid-containing oligosaccharides are promising prebiotics for the targeted enhancement of beneficial Faecalibacterium and underscore the importance of microbial interactions in prebiotic research, offering new avenues for personalized microbiome modulation strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf027
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-10,Proteomic evidence for aerobic methane production in groundwater by methylotrophic Methylotenera.,"Members of Methylotenera are signature denitrifiers and methylotrophs commonly found together with methanotrophic bacteria in lakes and freshwater sediments. Here we show that three distinct Methylotenera ecotypes were abundant in methane-rich groundwaters recharged during the Pleistocene. Just like in surface water biomes, groundwater Methylotenera often co-occurred with methane-oxidizing bacteria, even though they were generally unable to denitrify. One abundant Methylotenera ecotype expressed a pathway for aerobic methane production from methylphosphonate. This phosphate-acquisition strategy was recently found to contribute to methane production in the oligotrophic, oxic upper ocean. Gene organization, phylogeny, and 3D protein structure of the key enzyme, C-P lyase subunit PhnJ, were consistent with a role in phosphate uptake. We conclude that phosphate may be a limiting nutrient in productive, methane-rich aquifers, and that methylphosphonate degradation might contribute to groundwater methane production.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf024
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-08,Mechanisms of cooperation in the plants-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-bacteria continuum.,"In nature, cooperation is an essential way for species, whether they belong to the same kingdom or to different kingdoms, to overcome the scarcity of resources and improve their fitness. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic microorganisms whose origin date back 400 million years. They form symbiotic associations with the vast majority of terrestrial plants, helping them to obtain nutrients from the soil in exchange for carbon. At the more complex level, soil bacteria participate in the symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plants: they obtain carbon from the exudation of hyphae connected to the roots and compensate for the limited saprophytic capacity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by mineralizing organic compounds. Therefore, plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria constitute a continuum that may be accompanied by multiple forms of cooperation. In this review, we first analyzed the functional complementarities and differences between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Secondly, we discussed the resource exchange relationship between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from the perspective of biological market theory and ""surplus carbon"" hypothesis. Finally, on the basis of mechanisms for maintaining cooperation, direct and indirect reciprocity in the hyphosphere, induced by the availability of external resource and species fitness, were examined. Exploring these reciprocal cooperations will provide a better understanding of the intricate ecological relationships between plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria as well as their evolutionary implications.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf023
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-08,Strain identity effects contribute more to Pseudomonas community functioning than strain interactions.,"Microbial communities can shape key ecological services, but the determinants of their functioning often remain little understood. While traditional research predominantly focuses on effects related to species identity (community composition and species richness), recent work increasingly explores the impact of species interactions on community functioning. Here, we conducted experiments with replicated small communities of Pseudomonas bacteria to quantify the relative importance of strain identity versus interaction effects on two important functions, community productivity and siderophore production. By combining supernatant and competition assays with an established linear model method, we show that both factors have significant effects on functioning, but identity effects generally outweigh strain interaction effects. These results hold irrespective of whether strain interactions are inferred statistically or approximated experimentally. Our results have implications for microbiome engineering, as the success of approaches aiming to induce beneficial (probiotic) strain interactions will be sensitive to strain identity effects in many communities.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf025
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-06,Active bacteria driving N2O mitigation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in ammonia recovery bioreactors.,"Shifting from ammonia removal to recovery is the current strategy in wastewater treatment management. We recently developed a microaerophilic activated sludge system for retaining ammonia whereas removing organic carbon with minimal N2O emissions. A comprehensive understanding of nitrogen metabolisms in the system is essential to optimize system performance. Here, we employed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses to characterize the microbial community structure and activity during the transition from a microoxic to an oxic condition. A hybrid approach combining high-quality short reads and Nanopore long reads reconstructed 98 medium- to high-quality non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes from the communities. The suppressed bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) expression was upregulated after shifting from a microoxic to an oxic condition. Seventy-three reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes (>74% of the total) from 11 bacterial phyla harbored genes encoding proteins involved in nitrate respiration; 39 (~53%) carried N2O reductase (nosZ) genes with the predominance of clade II nosZ (31 metagenome-assembled genomes), and 24 (~33%) possessed nitrite reductase (ammonia-forming) genes (nrfA). Clade II nosZ and nrfA genes exhibited the highest and second-highest expressions among nitrogen metabolism genes, indicating robust N2O consumption and ammonification. Non-denitrifying clade II nosZ bacteria, Cloacibacterium spp., in the most abundant and active phylum Bacteroioda, were likely major N2O sinks. Elevated dissolved oxygen concentration inhibited clade II nosZ expression but not nrfA expression, potentially switching phenotypes from N2O reduction to ammonification. Collectively, the multi-omics analysis illuminated bacteria responsible for N2O reduction and ammonification in microoxic and oxic conditions, facilitating high-performance ammonia recovery.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf021
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-06,Metabolism of hemicelluloses by root-associated Bacteroidota species.,"Bacteroidota species are enriched in the plant microbiome and provide several beneficial functions for their host, including disease suppression. Determining the mechanisms that enable bacteroidota to colonise plant roots may therefore provide opportunities for enhancing crop production through microbiome engineering. By focusing on nutrient acquisition mechanisms, we discovered Bacteroidota species lack high affinity ATP-binding cassette transporters common in other plant bacteria for capturing simple carbon exudates. Instead, bacteroidota possess TonB-dependent transporters predicted to import glycans produced by plant polysaccharide breakdown. Metatranscriptomics (oat rhizosphere) identified several TonB-dependent transporters genes that were highly expressed in Flavobacterium (phylum Bacteroidota). Using Flavobacterium johnsoniae as the model, we experimentally validated the function of one highly expressed TonB-dependent transporters, identifying a conserved Xyloglucan Utilisation Loci conferring an ability to import xyloglucan, the major hemicellulose secreted from plant roots. Xyloglucan utilisation loci harbour an endoxyloglucanase related to family 5 subfamily 4 subclade 2D glycoside hydrolases carrying a mutation that we demonstrate is required for full activity towards xyloglucan. Based on analysing 700 soil metagenomes, subclade 2D glycoside hydrolases have radiated in soil and are prevalent among plant-associated bacteroidota and certain taxa affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria. In bacteroidota, particularly Flavobacterium species, xyloglucan utilisation loci organisation was highly conserved, which may increase their competitive ability to utilise xyloglucan. Given bacteroidota lack high-affinity nutrient transporters for simple carbon, instead possessing xyloglucan utilisation loci and similar gene clusters, our data suggests hemicellulose exudates provide them with an important carbon source in the rhizosphere.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf022
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-04,Metabolic labour division trade-offs in denitrifying microbiomes.,"Division of metabolic labour is a defining trait of natural and engineered microbiomes. Denitrification - the stepwise reduction of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogenous gases - is inherently modular, catalysed either by a single microorganism (termed complete denitrifier) or by consortia of partial denitrifiers. Despite the pivotal role of denitrification in biogeochemical cycles and environmental biotechnologies, the ecological factors selecting for complete versus partial denitrifiers remain poorly understood. In this perspective, we critically review over 1500 published metagenome-assembled genomes of denitrifiers from diverse and globally relevant ecosystems. Our findings highlight the widespread occurrence of labour division and the dominance of partial denitrifiers in complex ecosystems, contrasting with the prevalence of complete denitrifiers only in simple laboratory cultures. We challenge current labour division theories centred around catabolic pathways, and discuss their limits in explaining the observed niche partitioning. Instead, we propose that labour division benefits partial denitrifiers by minimising resource allocation to denitrification, enabling broader metabolic adaptability to oligotrophic and dynamic environments. Conversely, stable, nutrient-rich laboratory cultures seem to favour complete denitrifiers, which maximise energy generation through denitrification. To resolve the ecological significance of metabolic trade-offs in denitrifying microbiomes, we advocate for mechanistic studies that integrate mixed-culture enrichments mimicking natural environments, multi-meta-omics, and targeted physiological characterisations. These undertakings will greatly advance our understanding of global nitrogen turnover and nitrogenous greenhouse gases emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf020
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-02,Microbial reaction rate estimation using proteins and proteomes.,"Microbes transform their environments using diverse enzymatic reactions. However, it remains challenging to measure microbial reaction rates in natural environments. Despite advances in global quantification of enzyme abundances, the individual relationships between enzyme abundances and their reaction rates have not been systematically examined. Using matched proteomic and reaction rate data from microbial cultures, we show that enzyme abundance is often insufficient to predict its corresponding reaction rate. However, we discovered that global proteomic measurements can be used to make accurate rate predictions of individual reaction rates (median R2 = 0.78). Accurate rate predictions required only a small number of proteins and they did not need explicit prior mechanistic knowledge or environmental context. These results indicate that proteomes are encoders of cellular reaction rates, potentially enabling proteomic measurements in situ to estimate the rates of microbially mediated reactions in natural systems.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf018
{'ISME J'},2025-Feb-02,Core cooperative metabolism in low-complexity CO2-fixing anaerobic microbiota.,"Biological conversion of carbon dioxide into methane has a crucial role in global carbon cycling and is operated by a specialised set of anaerobic archaea. Although it is known that this conversion is strictly linked with cooperative bacterial activity, such as through syntrophic acetate oxidation, there is also a limited understanding on how this cooperation is regulated and metabolically realised. In this work, we investigate the activity in a microbial community evolved to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into methane and predominantly populated by Methanothermobacter wolfeii. Through multi-omics, biochemical analysis and constraint-based modelling, we identify a potential formate cross-feeding from an uncharacterised Limnochordia species to M. wolfeii, driven by the recently discovered reductive glycine pathway and upregulated when hydrogen and carbon dioxide are limited. The quantitative consistency of this metabolic exchange with experimental data is shown by metagenome-scale metabolic models integrating condition-specific metatranscriptomics, which also indicate a broader three-way interaction involving M. wolfeii, the Limnochordia species, and Sphaerobacter thermophilus. Under limited hydrogen and carbon dioxide, aspartate released by M. wolfeii is fermented by S. thermophilus into acetate, which in turn is convertible into formate by Limnochordia, possibly forming a cooperative loop sustaining hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. These findings expand our knowledge on the modes of carbon dioxide reduction into methane within natural microbial communities and provide an example of cooperative plasticity surrounding this process.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf017
