{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-29,Competitive and substrate limited environments drive metabolic heterogeneity for comammox Nitrospira.,"Nitrospira has been revealed as a high versatile genus. Although previously considered only responsible for the conversion of nitrite to nitrate, now we know that Nitrospira can perform complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate too (comammox). Comammox activity was firstly reported as dominant in extremely limited oxygen environments, where anaerobic ammonia oxidation was also occurring (anammox). To explain the comammox selection, we developed an Individual-based Model able to describe Nitrospira and anammox growth in suspended flocs assembled in a dynamic nitrogen and oxygen-limiting environment. All known and hypothesized nitrogen transformations of Nitrospira were considered: ammonia and nitrite oxidation, comammox, nitrate-reducing ammonia oxidation, and anaerobic nitrite-reducing ammonia oxidation. Through bioenergetics analysis, the growth yield associated to each activity was estimated. The other kinetic parameters necessary to describe growth were calibrated according to the reported literature values. Our modeling results suggest that even extremely low oxygen concentrations (~1.0 µM) allow for a proportional growth of anammox versus Nitrospira similar to the one experimentally observed. The strong oxygen limitation was followed by a limitation of ammonia and nitrite, because anammox, without strong competitors, were able to grow faster than Nitrospira depleting the environment in nitrogen. These substrate limitations created an extremely competitive environment that proved to be decisive in the community assembly of Nitrospira and anammox. Additionally, a diversity of metabolic activities for Nitrospira was observed in all tested conditions, which in turn, explained the transient nitrite accumulation observed in aerobic environments with higher ammonia availability.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00288-8
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-28,Nodulation number tempers the relative importance of stochastic processes in the assembly of soybean root-associated communities.,"Identifying the ecological forces that structure root-associated microbial communities is an essential step toward more sustainable agriculture. Legumes are widely utilized as model plants to study selective forces and their functioning in plant-microbial interactions owing to their ability to establish mutualism with rhizobia. Root nodules act as symbiotic organs to optimize the cost-benefit balance in this mutualistic relationship by modulating the number of nodules. However, it is not known whether the number of nodules is related to the structure of root-associated bacterial communities. Here, the root-associated bacterial communities of soybean grown in native soil by means of soybean cultivars with super- or normal nodulation were investigated across four developmental stages. We compared ecological processes between communities and found decreased relative importance of neutral processes for super-nodulating soybean, although the overall structures resembled those of normal-nodulating soybean. We identified the generalist core bacterial populations in each root-associated compartment, that are shared across root-associated niches, and persist through developmental stages. Within core bacterial species, the relative abundances of bacterial species in the rhizosphere microbiome were linked to host-plant functional traits and can be used to predict these traits from microbes using machine learning algorithms. These findings broaden the comprehensive understanding of the ecological forces and associations of microbiotas in various root-associated compartments and provide novel insights to integrate beneficial plant microbiomes into agricultural production to enhance plant performance.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00296-8
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-28,Identifying and tracking mobile elements in evolving compost communities yields insights into the nanobiome.,"Microbial evolution is driven by rapid changes in gene content mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are important drivers of gene flux, the nanobiome-the zoo of Darwinian replicators that depend on microbial hosts-remains poorly characterised. New approaches are necessary to increase our understanding beyond MGEs shaping individual populations, towards their impacts on complex microbial communities. A bioinformatic pipeline (xenoseq) was developed to cross-compare metagenomic samples from microbial consortia evolving in parallel, aimed at identifying MGE dissemination, which was applied to compost communities which underwent periodic mixing of MGEs. We show that xenoseq can distinguish movement of MGEs from demographic changes in community composition that otherwise confounds identification, and furthermore demonstrate the discovery of various unexpected entities. Of particular interest was a nanobacterium of the candidate phylum radiation (CPR) which is closely related to a species identified in groundwater ecosystems (Candidatus Saccharibacterium), and appears to have a parasitic lifestyle. We also highlight another prolific mobile element, a 313 kb plasmid hosted by a Cellvibrio lineage. The host was predicted to be capable of nitrogen fixation, and acquisition of the plasmid coincides with increased ammonia production. Taken together, our data show that new experimental strategies combined with bioinformatic analyses of metagenomic data stand to provide insight into the nanobiome as a driver of microbial community evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00294-w
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-25,Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> conveys a protective advantage to phycosphere-associated bacteria at high temperatures.,"Many marine microbes require vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) but are unable to synthesize it, necessitating reliance on other B<sub>12</sub>-producing microbes. Thus, phytoplankton and bacterioplankton community dynamics can partially depend on the production and release of a limiting resource by members of the same community. We tested the impact of temperature and B<sub>12</sub> availability on the growth of two bacterial taxa commonly associated with phytoplankton: Ruegeria pomeroyi, which produces B<sub>12</sub> and fulfills the B<sub>12</sub> requirements of some phytoplankton, and Alteromonas macleodii, which does not produce B<sub>12</sub> but also does not strictly require it for growth. For B<sub>12</sub>-producing R. pomeroyi, we further tested how temperature influences B<sub>12</sub> production and release. Access to B<sub>12</sub> significantly increased growth rates of both species at the highest temperatures tested (38 °C for R. pomeroyi, 40 °C for A. macleodii) and A. macleodii biomass was significantly reduced when grown at high temperatures without B<sub>12</sub>, indicating that B<sub>12</sub> is protective at high temperatures. Moreover, R. pomeroyi produced more B<sub>12</sub> at warmer temperatures but did not release detectable amounts of B<sub>12</sub> at any temperature tested. Results imply that increasing temperatures and more frequent marine heatwaves with climate change will influence microbial B<sub>12</sub> dynamics and could interrupt symbiotic resource sharing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00298-6
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-24,MArVD2: a machine learning enhanced tool to discriminate between archaeal and bacterial viruses in viral datasets.,"Our knowledge of viral sequence space has exploded with advancing sequencing technologies and large-scale sampling and analytical efforts. Though archaea are important and abundant prokaryotes in many systems, our knowledge of archaeal viruses outside of extreme environments is limited. This largely stems from the lack of a robust, high-throughput, and systematic way to distinguish between bacterial and archaeal viruses in datasets of curated viruses. Here we upgrade our prior text-based tool (MArVD) via training and testing a random forest machine learning algorithm against a newly curated dataset of archaeal viruses. After optimization, MArVD2 presented a significant improvement over its predecessor in terms of scalability, usability, and flexibility, and will allow user-defined custom training datasets as archaeal virus discovery progresses. Benchmarking showed that a model trained with viral sequences from the hypersaline, marine, and hot spring environments correctly classified 85% of the archaeal viruses with a false detection rate below 2% using a random forest prediction threshold of 80% in a separate benchmarking dataset from the same habitats.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00295-9
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-23,"Integrating microbial community properties, biomass and necromass to predict cropland soil organic carbon.","Manipulating microorganisms to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) in croplands remains a challenge. Soil microbes are important drivers of SOC sequestration, especially via their necromass accumulation. However, microbial parameters are rarely used to predict cropland SOC stocks, possibly due to uncertainties regarding the relationships between microbial carbon pools, community properties and SOC. Herein we evaluated the microbial community properties (diversity and network complexity), microbial carbon pools (biomass and necromass carbon) and SOC in 468 cropland soils across northeast China. We found that not only microbial necromass carbon but also microbial community properties (diversity and network complexity) and biomass carbon were correlated with SOC. Microbial biomass carbon and diversity played more important role in predicting SOC for maize, while microbial network complexity was more important for rice. Models to predict SOC performed better when the microbial community and microbial carbon pools were included simultaneously. Taken together our results suggest that microbial carbon pools and community properties influence SOC accumulation in croplands, and management practices that improve these microbial parameters may increase cropland SOC levels.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00300-1
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-19,Comparative genomics unveils extensive genomic variation between populations of Listeria species in natural and food-associated environments.,"Comprehending bacterial genomic variation linked to distinct environments can yield novel insights into mechanisms underlying differential adaptation and transmission of microbes across environments. Gaining such insights is particularly crucial for pathogens as it benefits public health surveillance. However, the understanding of bacterial genomic variation is limited by a scarcity of investigations in genomic variation coupled with different ecological contexts. To address this limitation, we focused on Listeria, an important bacterial genus for food safety that includes the human pathogen L. monocytogenes, and analyzed a large-scale genomic dataset collected by us from natural and food-associated environments across the United States. Through comparative genomics analyses on 449 isolates from the soil and 390 isolates from agricultural water and produce processing facilities representing L. monocytogenes, L. seeligeri, L. innocua, and L. welshimeri, we find that the genomic profiles strongly differ by environments within each species. This is supported by the environment-associated subclades and differential presence of plasmids, stress islands, and accessory genes involved in cell envelope biogenesis and carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Core genomes of Listeria species are also strongly associated with environments and can accurately predict isolation sources at the lineage level in L. monocytogenes using machine learning. We find that the large environment-associated genomic variation in Listeria appears to be jointly driven by soil property, climate, land use, and accompanying bacterial species, chiefly representing Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Collectively, our data suggest that populations of Listeria species have genetically adapted to different environments, which may limit their transmission from natural to food-associated environments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00293-x
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-19,Inter-comparison of marine microbiome sampling protocols.,"Research on marine microbial communities is growing, but studies are hard to compare because of variation in seawater sampling protocols. To help researchers in the inter-comparison of studies that use different seawater sampling methodologies, as well as to help them design future sampling campaigns, we developed the EuroMarine Open Science Exploration initiative (EMOSE). Within the EMOSE framework, we sampled thousands of liters of seawater from a single station in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Service d'Observation du Laboratoire Arago [SOLA], Banyuls-sur-Mer), during one single day. The resulting dataset includes multiple seawater processing approaches, encompassing different material-type kinds of filters (cartridge membrane and flat membrane), three different size fractionations (>0.22 µm, 0.22-3 µm, 3-20 µm and >20 µm), and a number of different seawater volumes ranging from 1 L up to 1000 L. We show that the volume of seawater that is filtered does not have a significant effect on prokaryotic and protist diversity, independently of the sequencing strategy. However, there was a clear difference in alpha and beta diversity between size fractions and between these and ""whole water"" (with no pre-fractionation). Overall, we recommend care when merging data from datasets that use filters of different pore size, but we consider that the type of filter and volume should not act as confounding variables for the tested sequencing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a publicly available dataset effectively allows for the clarification of the impact of marine microbiome methodological options across a wide range of protocols, including large-scale variations in sampled volume.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00278-w
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-18,A comparative study reveals the relative importance of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proton pump rhodopsins in a subtropical marginal sea.,"Proton-pump rhodopsin (PPR) in marine microbes can convert solar energy to bioavailable chemical energy. Whereas bacterial PPR has been extensively studied, counterparts in microeukaryotes are less explored, and the relative importance of the two groups is poorly understood. Here, we sequenced whole-assemblage metatranscriptomes and investigated the diversity and expression dynamics of PPR in microbial eukaryotes and prokaryotes at a continental shelf and a slope site in the northern South China Sea. Data showed the whole PPRs transcript pool was dominated by Proteorhodopsins and Xanthorhodopsins, followed by Bacteriorhodopsin-like proteins, dominantly contributed by prokaryotes both in the number and expression levels of PPR unigenes, although at the continental slope station, microeukaryotes and prokaryotes contributed similarly in transcript abundance. Furthermore, eukaryotic PPRs are mainly contributed by dinoflagellates and showed significant correlation with nutrient concentrations. Green light-absorbing PPRs were mainly distributed in >3 μm organisms (including microeukaryotes and their associated bacteria), especially at surface layer at the shelf station, whereas blue light-absorbing PPRs dominated the <3 μm (mainly bacterial) communities at both study sites, especially at deeper layers at the slope station. Our study portrays a comparative PPR genotype and expression landscape for prokaryotes and eukaryotes in a subtropical marginal sea, suggesting PPR's role in niche differentiation and adaptation among marine microbes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00292-y
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-18,Discovery of a novel bacterial class with the capacity to drive sulfur cycling and microbiome structure in a paleo-ocean analog.,"Uncultivated microbial taxa represent a large fraction of global microbial diversity and likely drive numerous biogeochemical transformations in natural ecosystems. Geographically isolated, polar ecosystems are complex microbial biomes and refuges of underexplored taxonomic and functional biodiversity. Combining amplicon sequencing with genome-centric metagenomic analysis of samples from one of the world's northernmost lakes (Lake A, Ellesmere Island, Canadian High Arctic), we identified a novel bacterial taxon that dominates in the bottom layer of anoxic, sulfidic, relict sea water that was isolated from the Arctic Ocean some 3000 years ago. Based on phylogenomic comparative analyses, we propose that these bacteria represent a new Class within the poorly described Electryoneota/AABM5-125-24 candidate phylum. This novel class, for which we propose the name Tariuqbacteria, may be either a relict of ancient ocean conditions or endemic to this High Arctic system, provisionally providing a rare example of high-taxonomy level endemism. Consistent with the geochemistry of the bottom water, the genetic composition of the Candidatus Tariuqbacter genome revealed a strictly anaerobic lifestyle with the potential for sulfate and sulfur reduction, a versatile carbon metabolism and the capability to eliminate competing bacteria through methylarsenite production, suggesting an allelochemical influence on microbiome structure by this planktonic microbe.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00287-9
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-18,Contrasting response of soil microbiomes to long-term fertilization in various highland cropping systems.,"Soil microbiomes play important roles in supporting agricultural ecosystems. However, it is still not well-known how soil microbiomes and their functionality respond to fertilization in various cropping systems. Here we examined the effects of 36 years of phosphorus, nitrogen, and manure application on soil bacterial communities, functionality and crop productivity in three contrasting cropping systems (i.e., continuous leguminous alfalfa (AC), continuous winter wheat (WC), and grain-legume rotation of winter wheat + millet - pea - winter wheat (GLR)) in a highland region of China's Loess Plateau. We showed that long-term fertilization significantly affected soil bacterial communities and that the effects varied with cropping system. Compared with the unfertilized control, fertilization increased soil bacterial richness and diversity in the leguminous AC system, whereas it decreased those in the GLR system. Fertilization, particularly manure application, enlarged the differences in soil bacterial communities among cropping systems. Soil bacterial communities were mostly affected by the soil organic carbon and nitrogen contents in the WC and GLR systems, but by the soil available phosphorous content in the AC system. Crop productivity was closely associated with the abundance of fertilization-responsive taxa in the three cropping systems. Our study highlights that legume and non-legume cropping systems should be disentangled when assessing the responses of soil microbial communities to long-term fertilizer application.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00286-w
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-18,Ocean-wide comparisons of mesopelagic planktonic community structures.,"For decades, marine plankton have been investigated for their capacity to modulate biogeochemical cycles and provide fishery resources. Between the sunlit (epipelagic) layer and the deep dark waters, lies a vast and heterogeneous part of the ocean: the mesopelagic zone. How plankton composition is shaped by environment has been well-explored in the epipelagic but much less in the mesopelagic ocean. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of trans-kingdom community assemblages thriving in the mesopelagic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), mesopelagic oxic, and their epipelagic counterparts. We identified nine distinct types of intermediate water masses that correlate with variation in mesopelagic community composition. Furthermore, oxygen, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and particle flux together appeared as the main drivers governing these communities. Novel taxonomic signatures emerged from OMZ while a global co-occurrence network analysis showed that about 70% of the abundance of mesopelagic plankton groups is organized into three community modules. One module gathers prokaryotes, pico-eukaryotes and Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) from oxic regions, and the two other modules are enriched in OMZ prokaryotes and OMZ pico-eukaryotes, respectively. We hypothesize that OMZ conditions led to a diversification of ecological niches, and thus communities, due to selective pressure from limited resources. Our study further clarifies the interplay between environmental factors in the mesopelagic oxic and OMZ, and the compositional features of communities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00279-9
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-18,Geochemical constraints on bacteriophage infectivity in terrestrial environments.,"Lytic phages can be potent and selective inhibitors of microbial growth and can have profound impacts on microbiome composition and function. However, there is uncertainty about the biogeochemical conditions under which phage predation modulates microbial ecosystem function, particularly in terrestrial systems. Ionic strength is critical for infection of bacteria by many phages, but quantitative data is limited on the ion thresholds for phage infection that can be compared with environmental ion concentrations. Similarly, while carbon composition varies in the environment, we do not know how this variability influences the impact of phage predation on microbiome function. Here, we measured the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 80 different inorganic ions for the infection of E. coli with two canonical dsDNA and ssRNA phages, T4 and MS2, respectively. Many alkaline earth metals and alkali metals enabled lytic infection but the ionic strength thresholds varied for different ions between phages. Additionally, using a freshwater nitrate-reducing microbiome, we found that the ability of lytic phages to influence nitrate reduction end-products depended upon the carbon source as well as ionic strength. For all phage:host pairs, the ion EC<sub>50</sub>s for phage infection exceeded the ion concentrations found in many terrestrial freshwater systems. Thus, our findings support a model where phages most influence terrestrial microbial functional ecology in hot spots and hot moments such as metazoan guts, drought influenced soils, or biofilms where ion concentration is locally or transiently elevated and nutrients are available to support the growth of specific phage hosts.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00297-7
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Aug-18,Bacterial and archaeal community distributions and cosmopolitanism across physicochemically diverse hot springs.,"Terrestrial hot springs harbor diverse microbial communities whose compositions are shaped by the wide-ranging physico-chemistries of individual springs. The effect of enormous physico-chemical differences on bacterial and archaeal distributions and population structures is little understood. We therefore analysed the prevalence and relative abundance of bacteria and archaea in the sediments (n = 76) of hot spring features, in the Taupō Volcanic Zone (New Zealand), spanning large differences in major anion water chemistry, pH (2.0-7.5), and temperature (17.5-92.9 °C). Community composition, based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) was strongly influenced by both temperature and pH. However, certain lineages characterized diverse hot springs. At the domain level, bacteria and archaea shared broadly equivalent community abundances across physico-chemically diverse springs, despite slightly lower bacteria-to-archaea ratios and microbial 16S rRNA gene concentrations at higher temperatures. Communities were almost exclusively dominated by Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota or Crenarchaeota. Eight archaeal and bacterial ASVs from Thermoplasmatales, Desulfurellaceae, Mesoaciditogaceae and Acidithiobacillaceae were unusually prevalent (present in 57.9-84.2% of samples) and abundant (1.7-12.0% sample relative abundance), and together comprised 44% of overall community abundance. Metagenomic analyses generated multiple populations associated with dominant ASVs, and showed characteristic traits of each lineage for sulfur, nitrogen and hydrogen metabolism. Differences in metabolic gene composition and genome-specific metabolism delineated populations from relatives. Genome coverage calculations showed that populations associated with each lineage were distributed across a physicochemically broad range of hot springs. Results imply that certain bacterial and archaeal lineages harbor different population structures and metabolic potentials for colonizing diverse hot spring environments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00291-z
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-21,Rapid and accurate taxonomic classification of cpn60 amplicon sequence variants.,"The ""universal target"" region of the gene encoding the 60 kDa chaperonin protein (cpn60, also known as groEL or hsp60) is a proven sequence barcode for bacteria and a useful target for marker gene amplicon-based studies of complex microbial communities. To date, identification of cpn60 sequence variants from microbiome studies has been accomplished by alignment of queries to a reference database. Naïve Bayesian classifiers offer an alternative identification method that provides variable rank classification and shorter analysis times. We curated a set of cpn60 barcode sequences to train the RDP classifier and tested its performance on data from previous human microbiome studies. Results showed that sequences accounting for 79%, 86% and 92% of the observations (read counts) in saliva, vagina and infant stool microbiome data sets were classified to the species rank. We also trained the QIIME 2 q2-feature-classifier on cpn60 sequence data and demonstrated that it gives results consistent with the standalone RDP classifier. Successful implementation of a naïve Bayesian classifier for cpn60 sequences will facilitate future microbiome studies and open opportunities to integrate cpn60 amplicon sequence identification into existing analysis pipelines.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00283-z
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-20,Longitudinal development of the airway metagenome of preterm very low birth weight infants during the first two years of life.,"Preterm birth is accompanied with many complications and requires severe therapeutic regimens at the neonatal intensive care unit. The influence of the above-mentioned factors on the premature-born infants' respiratory metagenome or more generally its maturation is unknown. We therefore applied shotgun metagenome sequencing of oropharyngeal swabs to analyze the airway metagenome development of 24 preterm infants from one week postpartum to 15 months of age. Beta diversity analysis revealed a distinct clustering of airway microbial communities from hospitalized preterms and samples after hospital discharge. At nine and 15 months of age, the preterm infants lost their hospital-acquired individual metagenome signatures towards a common taxonomic structure. However, ecological network analysis and Random Forest classification of cross-sectional data revealed that by this age the preterm infants did not succeed in establishing the uniform and stable bacterial community structures that are characteristic for healthy full-term infants.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00285-x
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-20,Partitioning of the denitrification pathway and other nitrite metabolisms within global oxygen deficient zones.,"Oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) account for about 30% of total oceanic fixed nitrogen loss via processes including denitrification, a microbially mediated pathway proceeding stepwise from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to N<sub>2</sub>. This process may be performed entirely by complete denitrifiers capable of all four enzymatic steps, but many organisms possess only partial denitrification pathways, either producing or consuming key intermediates such as the greenhouse gas N<sub>2</sub>O. Metagenomics and marker gene surveys have revealed a diversity of denitrification genes within ODZs, but whether these genes co-occur within complete or partial denitrifiers and the identities of denitrifying taxa remain open questions. We assemble genomes from metagenomes spanning the ETNP and Arabian Sea, and map these metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 56 metagenomes from all three major ODZs to reveal the predominance of partial denitrifiers, particularly single-step denitrifiers. We find niche differentiation among nitrogen-cycling organisms, with communities performing each nitrogen transformation distinct in taxonomic identity and motility traits. Our collection of 962 MAGs presents the largest collection of pelagic ODZ microorganisms and reveals a clearer picture of the nitrogen cycling community within this environment.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00284-y
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-15,Mining-impacted rice paddies select for Archaeal methylators and reveal a putative (Archaeal) regulator of mercury methylation.,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a microbially produced neurotoxin derived from inorganic mercury (Hg), which accumulation in rice represents a major health concern to humans. However, the microbial control of MeHg dynamics in the environment remains elusive. Here, leveraging three rice paddy fields with distinct concentrations of Hg (Total Hg (THg): 0.21-513 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dry wt. soil; MeHg: 1.21-6.82 ng g<sup>-1</sup> dry wt. soil), we resorted to metagenomics to determine the microbial determinants involved in MeHg production under contrasted contamination settings. We show that Hg methylating Archaea, along with methane-cycling genes, were enriched in severely contaminated paddy soils. Metagenome-resolved Genomes of novel putative Hg methylators belonging to Nitrospinota (UBA7883), with poorly resolved taxonomy despite high completeness, showed evidence of facultative anaerobic metabolism and adaptations to fluctuating redox potential. Furthermore, we found evidence of environmental filtering effects that influenced the phylogenies of not only hgcA genes under different THg concentrations, but also of two housekeeping genes, rpoB and glnA, highlighting the need for further experimental validation of whether THg drives the evolution of hgcAB. Finally, assessment of the genomic environment surrounding hgcAB suggests that this gene pair may be regulated by an archaeal toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, instead of the more frequently found arsR-like genes in bacterial methylators. This suggests the presence of distinct hgcAB regulation systems in bacteria and archaea. Our results support the emerging role of Archaea in MeHg cycling under mining-impacted environments and shed light on the differential control of the expression of genes involved in MeHg formation between Archaea and Bacteria.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00277-x
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-15,The predictive power of phylogeny on growth rates in soil bacterial communities.,"Predicting ecosystem function is critical to assess and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Quantitative predictions of microbially mediated ecosystem processes are typically uninformed by microbial biodiversity. Yet new tools allow the measurement of taxon-specific traits within natural microbial communities. There is mounting evidence of a phylogenetic signal in these traits, which may support prediction and microbiome management frameworks. We investigated phylogeny-based trait prediction using bacterial growth rates from soil communities in Arctic, boreal, temperate, and tropical ecosystems. Here we show that phylogeny predicts growth rates of soil bacteria, explaining an average of 31%, and up to 58%, of the variation within ecosystems. Despite limited overlap in community composition across these ecosystems, shared nodes in the phylogeny enabled ancestral trait reconstruction and cross-ecosystem predictions. Phylogenetic relationships could explain up to 38% (averaging 14%) of the variation in growth rates across the highly disparate ecosystems studied. Our results suggest that shared evolutionary history contributes to similarity in the relative growth rates of related bacteria in the wild, allowing phylogeny-based predictions to explain a substantial amount of the variation in taxon-specific functional traits, within and across ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00281-1
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-14,Phylogeny and biogeography of the algal DMS-releasing enzyme in the global ocean.,"Phytoplankton produce the volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS), an important infochemical mediating microbial interactions, which is also emitted to the atmosphere and affecting the global climate. Albeit the enzymatic source for DMS in eukaryotes was elucidated, namely a DMSP lyase (DL) called Alma1, we still lack basic knowledge regarding its taxonomic distribution. We defined unique sequence motifs which enable the identification of DL homologs (DLHs) in model systems and environmental populations. We used these motifs to predict DLHs in diverse algae by analyzing hundreds of genomic and transcriptomic sequences from model systems under stress conditions and from environmental samples. Our findings show that the DL enzyme is more taxonomically widespread than previously thought, as it is encoded by known algal taxa as haptophytes and dinoflagellates, but also by chlorophytes, pelagophytes and diatoms, which were conventionally considered to lack the DL enzyme. By exploring the Tara Oceans database, we showed that DLHs are widespread across the oceans and are predominantly expressed by dinoflagellates. Certain dinoflagellate DLHs were differentially expressed between the euphotic and mesopelagic zones, suggesting a functional specialization and an involvement in the metabolic plasticity of mixotrophic dinoflagellates. In specific regions as the Southern Ocean, DLH expression by haptophytes and diatoms was correlated with environmental drivers such as nutrient availability. The expanded repertoire of putative DL enzymes from diverse microbial origins and geographic niches suggests new potential players in the marine sulfur cycle and provides a foundation to study the cellular function of the DL enzyme in marine microbes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00280-2
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-11,Potential relevance between soybean nitrogen uptake and rhizosphere prokaryotic communities under waterlogging stress.,"Waterlogging in soil can limit the availability of nitrogen to plants by promoting denitrification and reducing nitrogen fixation and nitrification. The root-associated microorganisms that determine nitrogen availability at the root-soil interface can be influenced by plant genotype and soil type, which potentially alters the nitrogen uptake capacity of plants in waterlogged soils. In a greenhouse experiment, two soybean genotypes with contrasting capacities to resist waterlogging stress were grown in Udic Argosol and Haplic Alisol soils with and without waterlogging, respectively. Using isotope labeling, high-throughput amplicon sequencing and qPCR, we show that waterlogging negatively affects soybean yield and nitrogen absorption from fertilizer, atmosphere, and soil. These effects were soil-dependent and more pronounced in the waterlogging-sensitive than tolerant genotype. The tolerant genotype harbored more ammonia oxidizers and less nitrous oxide reducers. Anaerobic, nitrogen-fixing, denitrifying and iron-reducing bacteria such as Geobacter/Geomonas, Sphingomonas, Candidatus Koribacter, and Desulfosporosinus were proportionally enriched in association with the tolerant genotype under waterlogging. These changes in the rhizosphere microbiome might ultimately help the plant to improve nitrogen uptake under waterlogged, anoxic conditions. This research contributes to a better understanding of the adaptability of soybean genotypes under waterlogging stress and might help to formulate fertilization strategies that improve nitrogen use efficiency of soybean. Schematic representation of the effects of waterlogging on nitrogen uptake and rhizosphere microbiota in dependence of soil type and soybean genotype.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00282-0
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-10,Polyethylene degradation and assimilation by the marine yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa.,"Ocean plastic pollution is a severe environmental problem but most of the plastic that has been released to the ocean since the 1950s is unaccounted for. Although fungal degradation of marine plastics has been suggested as a potential sink mechanism, unambiguous proof of plastic degradation by marine fungi, or other microbes, is scarce. Here we applied stable isotope tracing assays with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled polyethylene to measure biodegradation rates and to trace the incorporation of plastic-derived carbon into individual cells of the yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, which we isolated from the marine environment. <sup>13</sup>C accumulation in the CO<sub>2</sub> pool during 5-day incubation experiments with R. mucilaginosa and UV-irradiated <sup>13</sup>C-labeled polyethylene as a sole energy and carbon source translated to degradation rates of 3.8% yr<sup>-1</sup> of the initially added substrate. Furthermore, nanoSIMS measurements revealed substantial incorporation of polyethylene-derived carbon into fungal biomass. Our results demonstrate the potential of R. mucilaginosa to mineralize and assimilate carbon from plastics and suggest that fungal plastic degradation may be an important sink for polyethylene litter in the marine environment.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00267-z
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-08,"Genomic copy number variability at the genus, species and population levels impacts in situ ecological analyses of dinoflagellates and harmful algal blooms.","The application of meta-barcoding, qPCR, and metagenomics to aquatic eukaryotic microbial communities requires knowledge of genomic copy number variability (CNV). CNV may be particularly relevant to functional genes, impacting dosage and expression, yet little is known of the scale and role of CNV in microbial eukaryotes. Here, we quantify CNV of rRNA and a gene involved in Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) synthesis (sxtA4), in 51 strains of 4 Alexandrium (Dinophyceae) species. Genomes varied up to threefold within species and ~7-fold amongst species, with the largest (A. pacificum, 130 ± 1.3 pg cell<sup>-1</sup> /~127 Gbp) in the largest size category of any eukaryote. Genomic copy numbers (GCN) of rRNA varied by 6 orders of magnitude amongst Alexandrium (10<sup>2</sup>- 10<sup>8</sup> copies cell<sup>-1</sup>) and were significantly related to genome size. Within the population CNV of rRNA was 2 orders of magnitude (10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>7</sup> cell<sup>-1</sup>) in 15 isolates from one population, demonstrating that quantitative data based on rRNA genes needs considerable caution in interpretation, even if validated against locally isolated strains. Despite up to 30 years in laboratory culture, rRNA CNV and genome size variability were not correlated with time in culture. Cell volume was only weakly associated with rRNA GCN (20-22% variance explained across dinoflagellates, 4% in Gonyaulacales). GCN of sxtA4 varied from 0-10<sup>2</sup> copies cell<sup>-1</sup>, was significantly related to PSTs (ng cell<sup>-1</sup>), displaying a gene dosage effect modulating PST production. Our data indicate that in dinoflagellates, a major marine eukaryotic group, low-copy functional genes are more reliable and informative targets for quantification of ecological processes than unstable rRNA genes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00274-0
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-07,Evaluating cpn60 for high-resolution profiling of the mammalian skin microbiome and detection of phylosymbiosis.,"Despite being the most widely used phylogenetic marker for amplicon-based profiling of microbial communities, limited phylogenetic resolution of the 16S rRNA gene limits its use for studies of host-microbe co-evolution. In contrast, the cpn60 gene is a universal phylogenetic marker with greater sequence variation capable of species-level resolution. This research compared mammalian skin microbial profiles generated from cpn60 and 16S rRNA gene sequencing approaches, testing for patterns of phylosymbiosis that suggest co-evolutionary host-microbe associations. An ~560 bp fragment of the cpn60 gene was amplified with universal primers and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Taxonomic classification of cpn60 sequences was completed using a naïve-Bayesian QIIME2 classifier created for this project, trained with an NCBI-supplemented curated cpn60 database (cpnDB_nr). The cpn60 dataset was then compared to published 16S rRNA gene amplicon data. Beta diversity comparisons of microbial community profiles generated with cpn60 and 16S rRNA gene amplicons were not significantly different, based on Procrustes analysis of Bray-Curtis and UniFrac distances. Despite similar relationships among skin microbial profiles, improved phylogenetic resolution provided by the cpn60 gene sequencing permitted observations of phylosymbiosis between microbial community profiles and their mammalian hosts that were not previously observed with 16S rRNA gene profiles. Subsequent investigation of Staphylococcaceae taxa using the cpn60 gene showed increased phylogenetic resolution compared the 16S rRNA gene profiles, revealing potential co-evolutionary host-microbe associations. Overall, our results demonstrate that 16S rRNA and cpn60 marker genes generate comparable microbial community composition patterns while cpn60 better facilitates analyses, such as phylosymbiosis, that require increased phylogenetic resolution.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00276-y
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-03,Large-scale omics dataset of polymer degradation provides robust interpretation for microbial niche and succession on different plastisphere.,"While biodegradable polymers have received increased attention due to the recent marine plastic problem, few studies have compared microbiomes and their degradation processes among biodegradable polymers. In this study, we set up prompt evaluation systems for polymer degradation, allowing us to collect 418 microbiome and 125 metabolome samples to clarify the microbiome and metabolome differences according to degradation progress and polymer material (polycaprolactone [PCL], polybutylene succinate-co-adipate [PBSA], polybutylene succinate [PBS], polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate [PBAT], and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [PHBH]). The microbial community compositions were converged to each polymer material, and the largest differences were observed between PHBH and other polymers. Such gaps were probably formed primarily by the presence of specific hydrolase genes (i.e., 3HB depolymerase, lipase, and cutinase) in the microorganisms. Time-series sampling suggested several steps for microbial succession: (1) initial microbes decrease abruptly after incubation starts; (2) microbes, including polymer degraders, increase soon after the start of incubation and show an intermediate peak; (3) microbes, including biofilm constructers, increase their abundance gradually. Metagenome prediction showed functional changes, where free-swimming microbes with flagella adhered stochastically onto the polymer, and certain microbes started to construct a biofilm. Our large-dataset-based results provide robust interpretations for biodegradable polymer degradation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00275-z
{'ISME Commun.'},2023-Jul-03,Evaluating the role of bacterial diversity in supporting soil ecosystem functions under anthropogenic stress.,"Ecosystem functions and services are under threat from anthropogenic global change at a planetary scale. Microorganisms are the dominant drivers of nearly all ecosystem functions and therefore ecosystem-scale responses are dependent on responses of resident microbial communities. However, the specific characteristics of microbial communities that contribute to ecosystem stability under anthropogenic stress are unknown. We evaluated bacterial drivers of ecosystem stability by generating wide experimental gradients of bacterial diversity in soils, applying stress to the soils, and measuring responses of several microbial-mediated ecosystem processes, including C and N cycling rates and soil enzyme activities. Some processes (e.g., C mineralization) exhibited positive correlations with bacterial diversity and losses of diversity resulted in reduced stability of nearly all processes. However, comprehensive evaluation of all potential bacterial drivers of the processes revealed that bacterial α diversity per se was never among the most important predictors of ecosystem functions. Instead, key predictors included total microbial biomass, 16S gene abundance, bacterial ASV membership, and abundances of specific prokaryotic taxa and functional groups (e.g., nitrifying taxa). These results suggest that bacterial α diversity may be a useful indicator of soil ecosystem function and stability, but that other characteristics of bacterial communities are stronger statistical predictors of ecosystem function and better reflect the biological mechanisms by which microbial communities influence ecosystems. Overall, our results provide insight into the role of microorganisms in supporting ecosystem function and stability by identifying specific characteristics of bacterial communities that are critical for understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to global change.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00273-1
