Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '17'}",Characterization of single neurons reprogrammed by pancreatic cancer.,"The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are infiltrated by PNS neurons, contributing to the complex tumor microenvironment (TME)<sup>1,2</sup>. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumor mass. Thus, cancer or healthy organ-innervating neurons elude current tissue sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single cell resolution, we developed ""Trace-n-seq"". This method employs retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing >5.000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons with about 4.000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas we reveal novel neuronal cell types and unique molecular networks distinct to pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC, or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuro-cancer-microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic cancer-nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a proinflammatory TME and increases immune-checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness. Nab-Paclitaxel causes intra-tumor neuropathy which attenuated PDAC growth and in combination with sympathetic denervation results in synergistic tumor regression. Our multi-dimensional data reveal new insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, supporting inclusion of denervation in future therapies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08735-3
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '17'}","Ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above 40 K in (La,Pr)<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> films.","The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-T<sub>C</sub>) superconductivity<sup>1-8</sup>. However, the high-pressure condition and presence of impurity phases have hindered comprehensive investigations into their superconducting properties and potential applications. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial thin films. Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La<sub>2.85</sub>Pr<sub>0.15</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> pure-phase single-crystal films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO<sub>4</sub> substrates<sup>9</sup>. Resistivity measurements and magnetic-field responses indicate onset T<sub>C</sub> = 45 K. The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with T<sub>BKT</sub> = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at T<sub>M</sub> = 8 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) reveal that the bilayer nickelate films adopt a tetragonal phase under ~2% coherent epitaxial compressive strain in the NiO<sub>2</sub> planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature through strain engineering in heterostructures.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08755-z
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Topological segregation of stress sensors along the gut crypt-villus axis.,"The crypt-villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part<sup>1,2</sup>. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut<sup>3-6</sup>. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1Â by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08581-9
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Intrinsic electrical activity drives small-cell lung cancer progression.,"Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types<sup>1,2</sup>; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness<sup>3</sup>. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte-neuron metabolite shuttle<sup>6</sup>. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08575-7
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Global engineering effects of soil invertebrates on ecosystem functions.,"The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems<sup>1,2</sup>. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates<sup>3</sup> at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08594-y
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Learned magnetic map cues and two mechanisms of magnetoreception in turtles.,"Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position<sup>1</sup>. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination<sup>2,3</sup>, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception<sup>4-6</sup>, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08554-y
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",A metagenomic 'dark matter' enzyme catalyses oxidative cellulose conversion.,"The breakdown of cellulose is one of the most important reactions in nature<sup>1,2</sup> and is central to biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals<sup>3</sup>. However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion<sup>4</sup>. Here, by mining the metagenomic 'dark matter' (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance<sup>5-7</sup>. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08553-z
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Learning produces an orthogonalized state machine in the hippocampus.,"Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning and behaviour. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus<sup>1</sup>, but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, 'state cells'). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08548-w
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Transcriptional adaptation upregulates utrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein<sup>1,2</sup>. Utrophin (UTRN), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD, is upregulated in some DMD patients<sup>3-5</sup>. To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD<sup>PTC</sup> minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD, aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD<sup>ÎE52</sup> patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation<sup>6-8</sup> plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD<sup>PTC</sup> patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation viaÂ transcriptional adaptation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08539-x
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",External Li supply reshapes Li deficiency and lifetime limit of batteries.,"Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries<sup>1</sup>. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime<sup>2</sup>. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed<sup>3</sup>. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0âV, 1,192âWhâkg<sup>-1</sup> Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388âWhâkg<sup>-1</sup> pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO<sub>4</sub> batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08465-y
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Shielding Pt/Î³-Mo<sub>2</sub>N by inert nano-overlays enables stable H<sub>2</sub> production.,"The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption-activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism<sup>1-3</sup>. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications<sup>4</sup>. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/Î³-Mo<sub>2</sub>N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of Î³-Mo<sub>2</sub>N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26âwt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mn>24,500</mn> <mspace></mspace> <msub><mrow><mtext>mol</mtext></mrow> <mrow> <msub><mrow><mi>H</mi></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow> </msub> </mrow> </msub> <mspace></mspace> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>mol</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mi>metal</mi></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn></mrow> </msubsup> <mspace></mspace> <msup><mrow><mtext>h</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn></mrow> </msup> </mrow> </math> .

Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Global biodiversity loss from outsourced deforestation.,"Globalization increasingly allows countries to externalize the environmental costs of land use, including biodiversity loss<sup>1</sup>. So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries<sup>2</sup>. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08569-5
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Direct experimental constraints on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket.,"Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested<sup>1-4</sup> and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude<sup>5,6</sup>. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2âpm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first,Â to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08479-6
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Manipulation of the altermagnetic order in CrSb via crystal symmetry.,"Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism<sup>1-6</sup> from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism<sup>4,5</sup>. Altermagnetic order is essentiallyÂ a magnetic crystal order<sup>7</sup>, determined by the magnetic-order (NÃ©el) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the NÃ©el vector orientations<sup>8-12</sup>. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear NÃ©el vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow><mn>1</mn> <mover><mn>1</mn> <mo>Â¯</mo></mover> <mn>00</mn></mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </math> /Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow><mn>11</mn> <mover><mn>2</mn> <mo>Â¯</mo></mover> <mn>0</mn></mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </math> . The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds aÂ new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology<sup>4,5</sup> but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08436-3
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Stronger and coarser-grained biodegradable zinc alloys.,"Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants<sup>1-5</sup>. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature<sup>6</sup>. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall-Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed 'accommodation twins' in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known 'mechanical twins' whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction<sup>7,8</sup>. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys-making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08415-8
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Aqueous-based recycling of perovskite photovoltaics.,"Cumulative silicon photovoltaic (PV) waste highlights the importance of considering waste recycling before the commercialization of emerging PV technologies<sup>1,2</sup>. Perovskite PVs are a promising next-generation technology<sup>3</sup>, in which recycling their end-of-life waste can reduce the toxic waste and retain resources<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation-recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment. With recycling, the levelized cost of electricityÂ also decreases forÂ both utility-scaleÂ and residential systems. This study highlights unique opportunities of perovskite PVs for holistic recycling and paves the way for a sustainable perovskite solar economy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08408-7
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Measuring racial educational disparities over time amongst top achievers.,"Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind<sup>1</sup>. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we focus on the 'racial excellence gap'-the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves<sup>4,5</sup>. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typicallyÂ ages 8-9) to high school (typicallyÂ ages 14-18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student's socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality<sup>6</sup> had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the 'racial glass ceiling'.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08536-0
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",A crucial role for the cortical amygdala in shaping social encounters.,"Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable resources. In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling<sup>1</sup>. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)-an extended olfactory structure-was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COApl<sup>Esr1</sup>) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COApl<sup>Esr1</sup> cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COApl<sup>Esr1</sup> projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COApl<sup>Esr1</sup> cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08540-4
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Converging mechanism of UM171 and KBTBD4 neomorphic cancer mutations.,"Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein-protein interactions to drive aberrant function<sup>1,2</sup>. As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma<sup>3</sup>, the most common embryonal brain tumour in children<sup>4</sup>. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST<sup>5</sup>. However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat Î²-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 Î²-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3-neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4-HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein-protein interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08533-3
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb', 'Day': '12'}",Macrophages protect against sensory axon loss in peripheral neuropathy.,"Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity<sup>1</sup>, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain<sup>2,3</sup>. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia<sup>4</sup>, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibreÂ density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages<sup>5</sup> and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes<sup>6</sup>, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into theÂ peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectinâ3.

By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1-CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition<sup>2,3</sup>. However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3-neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST-HDAC1/2-KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by baseÂ editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1. By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08532-4

In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers<sup>2,3</sup>, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibilityâ1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated geneâ101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLRâN requirement geneâ1 (NRG1)<sup>4</sup>. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1-SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1-SAG101-NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1-SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1-SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through itsÂ recognition of a modified host EDS1-SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1-SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08521-7

Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases-for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons<sup>1</sup> and retinal ganglion cells<sup>2-4</sup>-have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized<sup>5,6</sup>. Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can divergeÂ in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08518-2

Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. <sup>2,3</sup>). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane<sup>4,5</sup>. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1-AtSAG101-AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E<sup>5,6</sup>. We report structures of AtEDS1-AtSAG101-AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1-AtSAG101-AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1-AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1-AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1-AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic.

To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to haveÂ fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08516-4

It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both<sup>5-14</sup>.

Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes<sup>5-8,15,16</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08490-x

Here, we report a new synthetic method that furnishes one especially coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold,<sup>5,6</sup> using mild reaction conditions and an operationally-simple protocol. The methodology proceeds via the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently-generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of ~30 kcal/mol<sup>7</sup> and ~60 kcal/mol,<sup>6</sup> respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed via a Ï-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character,<sup>8</sup> an underutilized parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity, and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08745-1

Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases<sup>4-6</sup>. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII<sup>4</sup>, and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase<sup>7-12</sup> where individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here, we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body centered cubic (bcc) structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules exhibiting picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather exhibits rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals<sup>13,14</sup>. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will impact our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08750-4

Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected and tumor cells, accumulating evidence indicates certain granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates<sup>1</sup>. Recently, we found that the majority of tissue CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and in inflamed organs across other diseases express granzyme K (GZMK)<sup>2</sup>, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving C2 and C4. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In RA synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the major producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Further, Gzmk-deficient mice have less severe arthritis and dermatitis with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is entirely driven by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08713-9

Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the 'HYPOMAP'. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, asÂ based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find thatÂ 291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 'effector' genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI.

Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti-Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication<sup>3-5</sup>. Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin-antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08506-6

However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient's tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phaseâI trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stageâIII or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine.

All patients generated Tâcell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral Tâcell clones. Moreover, Tâcell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08507-5

To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus-lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer<sup>1</sup> ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer<sup>2</sup> ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry<sup>3</sup> along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 BC and grew rapidly after 3750-3350 BC. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite<sup>4,5</sup>.

Here we report genome-wide data from 81 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of its people. North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers<sup>6</sup> as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers.

Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use<sup>2</sup>. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08510-w

Î¦KZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery<sup>1-4</sup>. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), aÂ conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2Â and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized proteinâ1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces ofÂ Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08547-x

However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code.

Here, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, we show that although potent bNAbs can delay the onset of acute viremia, subclinical infections occur while bNAb levels remain high. Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that 'viral blips'-low and transient plasma viremia-often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- toÂ 400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08500-y

Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO, for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD, a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37Â (also known asÂ SKIC3), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08509-3

The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants<sup>1,2</sup>. These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments<sup>1,3</sup>. In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron's first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08511-9

Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interactionÂ between the PELO-HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instabilityÂ (MSI-H)Â tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO-HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO-HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08398-6

For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations<sup>2</sup>. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal's path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal's current location towards upcoming locations<sup>6-8</sup>. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point<sup>9,10</sup>, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials<sup>10</sup>. However, to bridge the animal's path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal's location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid Ã direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations thatÂ are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left-right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient 'look around' mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08527-1

In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source<sup>1,2</sup>. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating ('sloshing') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130âkmâs<sup>-1</sup> to 310âkmâs<sup>-1</sup> within aboutÂ 30âkpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only â²120âkmâs<sup>-1</sup> in the core, even within about 10âkpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08561-z

Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea<sup>4</sup>, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection.

In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now<sup>5-7</sup> falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino<sup>8</sup>, resultingÂ from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08543-1

Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail<sup>9-11</sup>. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle<sup>12-14</sup>.

B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08410-z
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Emergence of collective oscillations in massive human crowds.,"Dense crowds form some of the most dangerous environments in modern society<sup>1</sup>. Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities<sup>2-4</sup>. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people<sup>5,6</sup>. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San FermÃ­n festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition<sup>7</sup> towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08514-6
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Superfluid stiffness of twisted trilayer graphene superconductors.,"The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, Ï<sub>s</sub>, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of Ï<sub>s</sub> markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of Ï<sub>s</sub> to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of Ï<sub>s</sub> in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of Ï<sub>s</sub> at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature Ï<sub>s</sub> and the superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub>, reminiscent of Uemura's relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08444-3

Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions<sup>1</sup> and recent experimental indications<sup>2</sup> of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08494-7

Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth andÂ reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum andÂ ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that ofÂ any other known anseriform but like that ofÂ other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons).

Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains<sup>6</sup>. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point.

Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100-150âtCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup> by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR.

Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ESâ1927+654.

Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Directly imaging the cooling flow in the Phoenix cluster.,"In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 10<sup>7</sup>âkelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales<sup>1,2</sup>. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies<sup>3-6</sup> and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas<sup>7-9</sup> suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures<sup>10-16</sup>. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster<sup>17</sup> using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] Î» 7.652-Î¼m emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 10<sup>5.5</sup>âkelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emissionÂ that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and theÂ sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000Â solar masses per year. These data provide aÂ large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10<sup>5</sup>âkelvin and 10<sup>6</sup>âkelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it<sup>18</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08369-x

Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired<sup>2</sup>. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains<sup>3-6</sup>. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations<sup>3,7,8</sup>. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests 'slidetronics' device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays<sup>9</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08380-2
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",C-terminal amides mark proteins for degradation via SCF-FBXO31.,"During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts<sup>1</sup>. When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites<sup>2,3</sup>. Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins<sup>3-6</sup>; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF-FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08475-w
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Signatures of longitudinal spin pumping in a magnetic phase transition.,"A particle current generated by pumping in the absence of gradients in potential energy, density or temperature<sup>1</sup> is associated with non-trivial dynamics. A representative example is charge pumping that is associated with the quantum Hall effect<sup>2</sup> and the quantum anomalous Hall effect<sup>3</sup>. Spin pumping, the spin equivalent of charge pumping, refers to the emission of a spin current by magnetization dynamics<sup>4-7</sup>. Previous studies have focused solely on transversal spin pumping arising from classical dynamics, which corresponds to precessing atomic moments with constant magnitude. However, longitudinal spin pumping arising from quantum fluctuations, which correspond to a temporal change in the atomic moment's magnitude, remains unexplored. Here we experimentally investigate longitudinal spin pumping using iron-rhodium (FeRh), which undergoes a first-order antiferromagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition during which the atomic moment's magnitude varies over time. By injecting a charge current into a FeRh/platinum bilayer, we induce a rapid phase transition of FeRh in nanoseconds, leading to the emission of a spin current to the platinum layer. The observed inverse spin Hall signal is about one order of magnitude larger than expected for transversal spin pumping, suggesting the presence of longitudinal spin pumping driven by quantum fluctuations and indicating its superiority over classical transversal spin pumping. Our result highlights the significance of quantum fluctuations in spin pumping and holds broad applicability in diverse angular momentum dynamics, such as laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization<sup>8</sup>, orbital pumping<sup>9,10</sup> and quantum spin transfer<sup>11-13</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08367-z
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",The Ronne Ice Shelf survived the last interglacial.,"The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)<sup>1</sup> is the largest cause of uncertainty in long-term sea-level projections. In the last interglacial (LIG) around 125,000 years ago, data suggest that sea level was several metres higher than today<sup>2-4</sup>, and required a significant contribution from Antarctic ice loss, with WAIS usually implicated. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were warmer than today<sup>5-8</sup>, by amounts comparable to those expected by 2100 under moderate to high future warming scenarios. However, direct evidence about the size of WAIS in the LIG is sparse. Here we use sea salt data from an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to WAIS, to show that, during most of the LIG, the Ronne Ice Shelf was still in place, and close to its current extent. Water isotope data are consistent with a retreat of WAIS<sup>9</sup>, but seem inconsistent with more dramatic model realizations<sup>10</sup> in which both WAIS and the large Antarctic ice shelves were lost. This new constraint calls for a reappraisal of other elements of the LIG sea-level budget. It also weakens the observational basis that motivated model simulations projecting the highest end of projections for future rates of sea-level rise to 2300 and beyond.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08394-w
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Degradable thermosets via orthogonal polymerizations of a single monomer.,"Crosslinked thermosets are highly durable materials, but overcoming their petrochemical origins and inability to be recycled poses a grand challenge<sup>1-3</sup>. Many strategies to access crosslinked polymers that are bioderived or degradable-by-design have been proposed, but they require several resource-intensive synthesis and purification steps and are not yet feasible alternatives to conventional consumer materials<sup>4-8</sup>. Here we present a modular, one-pot synthesis of degradable thermosets from the commercially available, biosourced monomer 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF)<sup>9</sup>. In the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and photoacid generator, DHF undergoes slow ring-opening metathesis polymerization to give a soft polymer; then, exposure to light triggers strong acid generation and promotes the cationic polymerization of the same DHF monomer to spatially crosslink and strengthen the material<sup>10-12</sup>. By manipulating catalyst loading and light exposure, we can access materials with physical properties spanning orders of magnitude and achieve spatially resolved material domains. Importantly, the DHF-based thermosets undergo stimuli-selective degradation and can be recycled to theÂ monomer under mild heating. The use of two distinct polymerization mechanisms on a single functional group allows the synthesis of degradable and recyclable thermoset materials with precisely controlled properties.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08386-w

The key challenge is achieving selectivity for one particular C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H bond<sup>1-3</sup>. In recent years, metalloenzymes have been found to perform C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H bond functionalization<sup>4,5</sup>. Despite substantial progresses in the past two decades<sup>6,7</sup>, enzymatic halogenation and pseudohalogenation of unactivated C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H-providing a functional handle for further modification-have been achieved with only non-haem iron/Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and are therefore limited by the chemistry possible with these enzymes<sup>8</sup>. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a previously unknown halogenase ApnU, part of a protein family containing domain of unknown function 3328 (DUF3328). ApnU uses copper in its active site to catalyse iterative chlorinations on multiple unactivated C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H bonds. By taking advantage of the softer copper centre, we demonstrate that ApnU can catalyse unprecedented enzymatic C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H bond functionalization such as iodination and thiocyanation. Using biochemical characterization and proteomics analysis, we identified the functional oligomeric state of ApnU as a covalently linked homodimer, which contains three essential pairs-one interchain and two intrachain-of disulfide bonds. The metal-coordination active site in ApnU consists of binuclear type II copper centres, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This discovery expands the enzymatic capability of C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H halogenases and provides a foundational understanding of this family of binuclear copper-dependent oxidative enzymes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08362-4
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Bat genomes illuminate adaptations to viral tolerance and disease resistance.,"Zoonoses are infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans. Bats have been suggested to harbour more zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian order<sup>1</sup>. Infections in bats are largely asymptomatic<sup>2,3</sup>, indicating limited tissue-damaging inflammation and immunopathology. To investigate the genomic basis of disease resistance, the Bat1K project generated reference-quality genomes of ten bat species, including potential viral reservoirs. Here we describe a systematic analysis covering 115 mammalian genomes that revealed that signatures of selection in immune genes are more prevalent in bats than in other mammalian orders. We found an excess of immune gene adaptations in the ancestral chiropteran branch and in many descending bat lineages, highlighting viral entry and detection factors, and regulators of antiviral and inflammatory responses. ISG15, which is an antiviral gene contributing to hyperinflammation during COVID-19 (refs. <sup>4,5</sup>), exhibits key residue changes in rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats. Cellular infection experiments show species-specific antiviral differences and an essential role of protein conjugation in antiviral function of bat ISG15, separate from its role in secretion and inflammation in humans. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, ISG15 in most rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats has strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms that contribute to viral tolerance and disease resistance in bats.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08471-0
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Resolving native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor structures from the human brain.,"Type A GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors) mediate most fast inhibitory signalling in the brain and are targets for drugs that treat epilepsy, anxiety, depression and insomnia and for anaesthetics<sup>1,2</sup>. These receptors comprise a complex array of 19 related subunits, which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The composition and structure of native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the human brain have been inferred from subunit localization in tissue<sup>1,3</sup>, functional measurements and structural analysis from recombinant expression<sup>4-7</sup> and in mice<sup>8</sup>. However, the arrangements of subunits that co-assemble physiologically in native human GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors remain unknown. Here we isolated Î±1 subunit-containingÂ GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from human patients with epilepsy. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a set of 12 native subunit assemblies and their 3D structures. We address inconsistencies between previous native and recombinant approaches, and reveal details of previously undefined subunit interfaces. Drug-like densities in a subset of these interfaces led us to uncover unexpected activity on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor of antiepileptic drugs and resulted in localization of one of these drugs to the benzodiazepine-binding site. Proteomics and further structural analysis suggest interactions with the auxiliary subunits neuroligin 2 and GARLH4, which localize and modulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses. This work provides a structural foundation for understanding GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor signalling and targeted pharmacology in the human brain.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08454-1

As clinical sequencing technologies continue to advance, the ability to identify patients with rare disease harbouring pathogenic genetic variants amenable to this therapeutic strategy will probably improve. Here we describe a scalable platform for generating patient-derived cellular models and demonstrate that these personalized models can be used for preclinical evaluation of patient-specific ASOs. We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes. The approach outlined here provides the foundation for an expedited path towards the design and preclinical evaluation of personalized ASO therapeutics for a broad range of rare diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08462-1
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",The maternal X chromosome affects cognition and brain ageing in female mice.,"Female mammalian cells have two X chromosomes, one of maternal origin and one of paternal origin. During development, one X chromosome randomly becomes inactivated<sup>1-4</sup>. This renders either the maternal X (X<sub>m</sub>) chromosome or the paternal X (X<sub>p</sub>) chromosome inactive, causing X mosaicism that varies between female individuals, with some showing considerable or complete skew of the X chromosome that remains active<sup>5-7</sup>. Parent-of-X origin can modify epigenetics through DNA methylation<sup>8,9</sup> and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in ageing and disease. However, whether X skew or its mosaicism alters functions in female individuals is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew towards an active X<sub>m</sub> chromosome influences the brain and body-and then delineated unique features of X<sub>m</sub> neurons and X<sub>p</sub> neurons. An active X<sub>m</sub> chromosome impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan and led to worsened cognition with age. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by X<sub>m</sub>-mediated acceleration of biological or epigenetic ageing of the hippocampus, a key centre for learning and memory, in female mice. Several genes were imprinted on the X<sub>m</sub> chromosome of hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. CRISPR-mediated activation of X<sub>m</sub>-imprinted genes improved cognition in ageing female mice. Thus, the X<sub>m</sub> chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain ageing and silenced genes that contribute to cognition in ageing. Understanding how X<sub>m</sub> impairs brain function could lead to an improved understanding of heterogeneity in cognitive health in female individuals and to X-chromosome-derived pathways that protect against cognitive deficits and brain ageing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08457-y
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Regional and institutional trends in assessment for academic promotion.,"The assessment of research performance is widely seen as a vital tool in upholding the highest standards of quality, with selection and competition believed to drive progress. Academic institutions need to take critical decisions on hiring and promotion, while facing external pressure by also being subject to research assessment<sup>1-4</sup>. Here we present an outlook on research assessment for career progression with specific focus on promotion to full professorship, based on 314 policies from 190 academic institutions and 218 policies from 58 government agencies, covering 32 countries in the Global North and 89 countries in the Global South. We investigated how frequently various promotion criteria are mentioned and carried out a statistical analysis to infer commonalities and differences across policies. Although quantitative methods of assessment remain popular, in agreement with what is found in more geographically restricted studies<sup>5-9</sup>, they are not omnipresent. We find differences between the Global North and the Global South as well as between institutional and national policies, but less so between disciplines. A preference for bibliometric indicators is more marked in upper-middle-income countries. Although we see some variation, many promotion policies are based on the assumption of specific career paths that become normative rather than embracing diversity. In turn, this restricts opportunities for researchers. These results challenge current practice and have strategic implications for researchers, research managers and national governments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08422-9
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer in the tumour microenvironment.,"Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment use various mechanisms to evade the immune system, particularly Tâcell attack<sup>1</sup>. For example, metabolic reprogramming in the tumour microenvironment and mitochondrial dysfunction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) impair antitumour immune responses<sup>2-4</sup>. However, detailed mechanisms of such processes remain unclear. Here we analyse clinical specimens and identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in TILs that are shared with cancer cells. Moreover, mitochondria with mtDNA mutations from cancer cells are able to transfer to TILs. Typically, mitochondria in TILs readily undergo mitophagy through reactive oxygen species. However, mitochondria transferred from cancer cells do not undergo mitophagy, which we find is due to mitophagy-inhibitory molecules. These molecules attach to mitochondria and together are transferred to TILs, which results in homoplasmic replacement. Tâcells that acquire mtDNA mutations from cancer cells exhibit metabolic abnormalities and senescence, with defects in effector functions and memory formation. This in turn leads to impaired antitumour immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, the presence of an mtDNA mutation in tumour tissue is a poor prognostic factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of cancer immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer and can contribute to the development of future cancer immunotherapies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08439-0
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",GZMK-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells promote recurrent airway inflammatory diseases.,"Inflammatory diseases are often chronic and recurrent, and current treatments do not typically remove underlying disease drivers<sup>1</sup>. T cells participate in a wide range of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis<sup>2</sup>, Crohn's disease<sup>3</sup>, oesophagitis<sup>4</sup> and multiple sclerosis<sup>5,6</sup>, and clonally expanded antigen-specific T cells may contribute to disease chronicity and recurrence, in part by forming persistent pathogenic memory. Chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma are inflammatory airway diseases that often present as comorbidities<sup>7</sup>. Chronic rhinosinusitis affects more than 10% of the general population<sup>8</sup>. Among these patients, 20-25% would develop nasal polyps, which often require repeated surgical resections owing to a high incidence of recurrence<sup>9</sup>. Whereas abundant T cells infiltrate the nasal polyps tissue<sup>10,11</sup>, T cell subsets that drive the disease pathology and promote recurrence are not fully understood. By comparing T cell repertoires in nasal polyp tissues obtained from consecutive surgeries, here we report that persistent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones carrying effector memory-like features colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence, and these cells characteristically express the tryptase Granzyme K (GZMK). We find that GZMK cleaves many complement components, including C2, C3, C4 and C5, that collectively contribute to the activation of the complement cascade. GZMK-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells participate in organized tertiary lymphoid structures, and tissue GZMK levels predict the disease severity and comorbidities better than well-established biomarkers such as eosinophilia and tissue interleukin-5. Using a mouse asthma model, we further show that GZMK-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exacerbate the disease in a manner dependent on the proteolytic activity of GZMK and complements. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of GZMK after the disease onset markedly alleviates tissue pathology and restores lung function. Our work identifies a pathogenic CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell subset that promotes tissue inflammation and recurrent airway diseases by the effector molecule GZMK and suggests GZMK as a potential therapeutic target.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08395-9

However, mice lacking its putative target, protein kinase PKMÎ¶, exhibit normal learning and memory as well as LTP<sup>2,3</sup>, making the mechanism of ZIP unclear. Here we show that ZIP disrupts LTP by removing surface AMPA receptors through its cationic charge alone. This effect requires endophilin-A2-mediated endocytosis and is fully blocked by drugs suppressing macropinocytosis. ZIP and other cationic peptides remove newly inserted AMPA receptor nanoclusters at potentiated synapses, providing a mechanism by which these peptides erase memories without altering basal synaptic function. When delivered in vivo, cationic peptides canÂ modulate memories on local and brain-wide scales, and these mechanisms can be leveraged to prevent memory loss in a model of traumatic brain injury. Our findings uncover a previously unknown synaptic mechanism by which memories are maintained or lost.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08413-w

Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders<sup>4-8</sup>, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Here we reveal that the transcription factors SOX4, SOX11 and TFAP2D have a pivotal role in the development, identity and PFC connectivity of these excitatory neurons. The absence of SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic excitatory neurons results in a marked reduction in the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum (CLA) and PIR. These transcription factors control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including in humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing excitatory neurons of BLC, CLA, PIR and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. Although the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat-response behaviours, differences emerge in the phenotypes at different Tfap2d dosages, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and BLC-PFC connectivity. This underscores the importance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioural modifications that resemble symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial VLp excitatory neurons and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08361-5
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Meta-analysis reveals global variations in plant diversity effects on productivity.,"Positive effects of plant diversity on productivity have been globally demonstrated and explained by two main effects: complementarity effects and selection effects<sup>1-4</sup>. However, plant diversity experiments have shown substantial variation in these effects, with driving factors poorly understood<sup>4-6</sup>. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 452 experiments across the globe, we show that productivity increases on average by 15.2% from monocultures to species mixtures with an average species richness of 2.6; net biodiversity effects are stronger in grassland and forest experiments and weaker in container, cropland and aquatic ecosystems. Of the net biodiversity effects, complementarity effects and selection effects contribute 65.6% and 34.4%, respectively. Complementarity effects increase with phylogenetic diversity, the mixing of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species and the functional diversity of leaf nitrogen contents, which indicate the key roles of niche partitioning, biotic feedback and abiotic facilitation in complementarity effects. More positive selection effects occur with higher species biomass inequality in their monocultures. Complementarity effects increase over time, whereas selection effects decrease over time, and they remain consistent across global variations in climates. Our results provide key insights into understanding global variations in plant diversity effects on productivity and underscore the importance of integrating both complementarity and selection effects into strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08407-8

To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods<sup>4,5</sup> are used to guide environmental policy<sup>6</sup> and conservation prioritization<sup>7</sup>, whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors<sup>8-13</sup>. However, there is evidence<sup>14-17</sup> that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals<sup>18,19</sup>. Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08375-z

Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells<sup>6</sup>. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay<sup>7</sup>. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model<sup>8</sup>. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology<sup>9</sup> for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign.

Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",A rare PRIMER cell state in plant immunity.,"Plants lack specialized and mobile immune cells. Consequently, any cell type that encounters pathogens must mount immune responses and communicate with surrounding cells for successful defence. However, the diversity, spatial organization and function of cellular immune states in pathogen-infected plants are poorly understood<sup>1</sup>. Here we infect Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with bacterial pathogens that trigger or supress immune responses and integrate time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data to identify cell states. We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis-regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08383-z
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Host metabolism balances microbial regulation of bile acid signalling.,"Metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota, including bile acids (BA), extensively modulate vertebrate physiology, including development<sup>1</sup>, metabolism<sup>2-4</sup>, immune responses<sup>5-7</sup> and cognitive function<sup>8</sup>. However, to what extent host responses balance the physiological effects of microbiota-derived metabolites remains unclear<sup>9,10</sup>. Here, using untargeted metabolomics of mouse tissues, we identified a family of BA-methylcysteamine (BA-MCY) conjugates that are abundant in the intestine and dependent on vanin 1 (VNN1), a pantetheinase highly expressed in intestinal tissues. This host-dependent MCY conjugation inverts BA function in the hepatobiliary system. Whereas microbiota-derived free BAs function as agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and negatively regulate BA production, BA-MCYs act as potent antagonists of FXR and promote expression of BA biosynthesis genes in vivo. Supplementation with stable-isotope-labelled BA-MCY increased BA production in an FXR-dependent manner, and BA-MCY supplementation in a mouse model of hypercholesteraemia decreased lipid accumulation in the liver, consistent with BA-MCYs acting as intestinal FXR antagonists. The levels of BA-MCY were reduced in microbiota-deficient mice and restored by transplantation of human faecal microbiota. Dietary intervention with inulin fibre further increased levels of both free BAs and BA-MCY levels, indicating that BA-MCY production by the host is regulated by levels of microbiota-derived free BAs. We further show that diverse BA-MCYs are also present in human serum. Together, our results indicate that BA-MCY conjugation by the host balances host-dependent and microbiota-dependent metabolic pathways that regulate FXR-dependent physiology.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08379-9
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Complex rearrangements fuel ER<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>+</sup> breast tumours.,"Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease whose prognosis and treatment as defined by the expression of three receptors-oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptorâ2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2)-is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Previously, we demonstrated that transcriptional and genomic profiles define eleven integrative subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, including four ER<sup>+</sup> subtypes with increased risk of relapse decades after diagnosis<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, to determine whether these subtypes reflect distinct evolutionary histories, interactions with the immune system and pathway dependencies, we established a meta-cohort of 1,828 breast tumours spanning pre-invasive, primary invasive and metastatic disease with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. We demonstrate that breast tumours fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes. The ER<sup>+</sup> high-risk integrative subgroup is characterized by complex focal amplifications, similar to HER2<sup>+</sup> tumours, including cyclic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications induced by ER through R-loop formation and APOBEC3B-editing, which arise in pre-invasive lesions. By contrast, triple-negative tumours exhibit genome-wide instability and tandem duplications and are enriched for homologous repair deficiency-like signatures, whereas ER<sup>+</sup> typical-risk tumours are largely genomically stable. These genomic archetypes, which replicate in an independent cohort of 2,659 primary tumours, are established early during tumorigenesis, sculpt the tumour microenvironment and are conserved in metastatic disease. These complex structural alterations contribute to replication stress and immune evasion, and persist throughout tumour evolution, unveiling potential vulnerabilities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08377-x
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Saturation genome editing-based clinical classification of BRCA2 variants.,"Sequencing-based genetic tests have uncovered a vast array of BRCA2 sequence variants<sup>1</sup>. Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance<sup>2-4</sup> (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR-Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15-26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479-3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs. This classification is available as a sequence-function map and serves as a valuable resource for interpreting unidentified variants in the population and for physicians and genetic counsellors to assess BRCA2 VUS in patients.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08349-1
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Dysregulation of mTOR signalling is a converging mechanism in lissencephaly.,"Cerebral cortex development in humans is a highly complex and orchestrated process that is under tight genetic regulation. Rare mutations that alter gene expression or function can disrupt the structure of the cerebral cortex, resulting in a range of neurological conditions<sup>1</sup>. Lissencephaly ('smooth brain') spectrum disorders comprise a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous congenital brain malformations commonly associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability<sup>2</sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we establish hypoactivity of the mTOR pathway as a clinically relevant molecular mechanism in lissencephaly spectrum disorders. We characterized two types of cerebral organoid derived from individuals with genetically distinct lissencephalies with a recessive mutation in p53-induced death domain proteinâ1 (PIDD1) or a heterozygous chromosome 17p13.3 microdeletion leading to Miller-Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS). PIDD1-mutant organoids and MDLS organoids recapitulated the thickened cortex typical of human lissencephaly and demonstrated dysregulation of protein translation, metabolism and the mTOR pathway. A brain-selective activator of mTOR complexâ1 prevented and reversed cellular and molecular defects in the lissencephaly organoids. Our findings show that a converging molecular mechanism contributes to two genetically distinct lissencephaly spectrum disorders.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08341-9
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Gliomagenesis mimics an injury response orchestrated by neural crest-like cells.,"Glioblastoma is an incurable brain malignancy. By the time of clinical diagnosis, these tumours exhibit a degree of genetic and cellular heterogeneity that provides few clues to the mechanisms that initiate and drive gliomagenesis<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, to explore the early steps in gliomagenesis, we utilized conditional gene deletion and lineage tracing in tumour mouse models, coupled with serial magnetic resonance imaging, to initiate and then closely track tumour formation. We isolated labelled and unlabelled cells at multiple stages-before the first visible abnormality, at the time of the first visible lesion, and then through the stages of tumour growth-and subjected cells of each stage to single-cell profiling. We identify a malignant cell state with a neural crest-like gene expression signature that is highly abundant in the early stages, but relatively diminished in the late stage of tumour growth. Genomic analysis based on the presence of copy number alterations suggests that these neural crest-like states exist as part of a heterogeneous clonal hierarchy that evolves with tumour growth. By exploring the injury response in wounded normal mouse brains, we identify cells with a similar signature that emerge following injury and then disappear over time, suggesting that activation of an injury response program occurs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, our experiments reveal a non-malignant injury-like microenvironment that is initiated in the brain following oncogene activation in cerebral precursor cells. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the early stages of glioblastoma, identifying a unique cell state and an injury response program tied to early tumour formation. These findings have implications for glioblastoma therapies and raise new possibilities for early diagnosis and prevention of disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08356-2
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Bone marrow niches orchestrate stem-cell hierarchy and immune tolerance.,"Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, termed niches, at several different locations in tissues<sup>1-3</sup>. The differential functions of heterogeneous stem cells and niches are important given the increasing clinical applications of stem-cell transplantation and immunotherapy. Whether hierarchical structures among stem cells at distinct niches exist and further control aspects of immune tolerance is unknown. Here we describe previously unknown new hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow niches that dictate both regenerative potential and immune privilege. High-level nitric oxide-generating (NO<sup>hi</sup>) HSCs are refractory to immune attack and exhibit delayed albeit robust long-term reconstitution. Such highly immune-privileged, primitive NO<sup>hi</sup> HSCs co-localize with distinctive capillaries characterized by primary ciliated endothelium and high levels of the immune-checkpoint molecule CD200. These capillaries regulate the regenerative functions of NO<sup>hi</sup> HSCs through the ciliary protein IFT20 together with CD200, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and autophagy signals, which further mediate immunoprotection. Notably, previously described niche constituents, sinusoidal cells and type-H vessels<sup>2-10</sup> co-localize with less immune-privileged and less potent NO<sup>low</sup> HSCs. Together, we identify highly immune-privileged, late-rising primitive HSCs and characterize their immunoprotective niches comprising specialized vascular domains. Our results indicate that the niche orchestrates hierarchy in stem cells and immune tolerance, and highlight future immunotherapeutic targets.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08352-6
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Brain-wide cell-type-specific transcriptomic signatures of healthy ageing in mice.,"Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function<sup>1,2</sup>. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types<sup>3</sup>, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2âmillion high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08350-8
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Aspartate signalling drives lung metastasis via alternative translation.,"Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours<sup>1,2</sup>. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells<sup>4,5</sup>. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation<sup>6</sup>. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFÎ² signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08335-7
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Spatial transcriptomic clocks reveal cell proximity effects in brain ageing.,"Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk<sup>1</sup>. Brain ageing is complex and is accompanied by many cellular changes<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, the influence that aged cells have on neighbouring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in ageing tissues have not yet been developed. Here we generate a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages across the adult lifespan and across two rejuvenating interventions-exercise and partial reprogramming. We build spatial ageing clocks, machine learning models trained on this spatial transcriptomics atlas, to identify spatial and cell-type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial ageing clocks and deep learning, we find that T cells, which increasingly infiltrate the brain with age, have a marked pro-ageing proximity effect on neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating proximity effect on neighbouring cells. We also identify potential mediators of the pro-ageing effect of T cells and the pro-rejuvenating effect of neural stem cells on their neighbours. These results suggest that rare cell types can have a potent influence on their neighbours and could be targeted to counter tissue ageing. Spatial ageing clocks represent a useful tool for studying cell-cell interactions in spatial contexts and should allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for ageing and disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08334-8
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Hierarchical design of pseudosymmetric protein nanocages.,"Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions<sup>1,2</sup>. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry<sup>3</sup>. Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96ânm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08360-6
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Nucleosome fibre topology guides transcription factor binding to enhancers.,"Cellular identity requires the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound together to enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. Despite TFs recognizing specific DNA motifs within accessible chromatin, this information is insufficient to explain how TFs select enhancers<sup>1</sup>. Here we compared four different TF combinations that induce different cell states, analysing TF genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of TFs. When bound together, TFs act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels TF combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, TFs assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing TF combinatorial binding to enhancers.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08333-9

Higher triangulation number viruses possess very sophisticated functionalities; our general route to higher triangulation number nanocages should similarly enable a next generation of multiple antigen-displaying vaccine candidates<sup>10,11</sup> and targeted delivery vehicles<sup>12,13</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07814-1
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Io's tidal response precludes a shallow magma ocean.,"Io experiences tidal deformation as a result of its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io's continuing volcanic activity and infrared emission<sup>1</sup>. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been suggested to support the large-scale melting of its interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior<sup>2</sup>. Here we report the measurement of Io's tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k<sub>2</sub>, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno<sup>3,4</sup> and Galileo<sup>5-7</sup> Doppler data from the NASA Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k<sub>2</sub>) of 0.125âÂ±â0.047 (1Ï) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4âÂ±â3.6 (1Ï). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle<sup>2</sup>. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming owing to rapid melt ascent, intrusion and eruption<sup>8,9</sup>, so even strong tidal heating-such as that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths<sup>10</sup>-may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08442-5

They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation<sup>2</sup> steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures<sup>3</sup>. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains<sup>4,5</sup>. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08306-y
Nature,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Feb'}",Structures and mechanism of condensation in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis.,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are megaenzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of many clinically important natural products, from early modern medicines (penicillin, bacitracin) to current blockbuster drugs (cubicin, vancomycin) and newly approved therapeutics (rezafungin)<sup>1,2</sup>. The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalysed by the condensation (C) domain<sup>3</sup>. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction<sup>3-12</sup>. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. Here we have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogues<sup>13,14</sup>, assembled the two parts with protein ligation<sup>15</sup>, and solved the structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show the precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and enable biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPS C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, whereby the active-site histidine likely functions not as a general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08417-6
