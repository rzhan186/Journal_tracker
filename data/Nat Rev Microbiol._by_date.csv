Nature,2024-May,Copper-catalysed dehydrogenation or lactonization of C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H bonds.,"Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to catalyse bimodal oxidation of aliphatic acids via radical intermediates, which partition between pathways of hydroxylation and desaturation<sup>1,2</sup>. Developing analogous catalytic systems for remote C-H functionalization remains a significant challenge<sup>3-5</sup>. Here, we report the development of Cu(I)-catalysed bimodal dehydrogenation/lactonization reactions of synthetically common N-methoxyamides through radical abstractions of the γ-aliphatic C-H bonds. The feasibility of switching from dehydrogenation to lactonization is also demonstrated by altering reaction conditions. The use of a readily available amide as both radical precursor and internal oxidant allows for the development of redox-neutral C-H functionalization reactions with methanol as the sole side product. These C-H functionalization reactions using a Cu(I) catalyst with loading as low as 0.5 mol.% is applied to the diversification of a wide range of aliphatic acids including drug molecules and natural products. The exceptional compatibility of this catalytic system with a wide range of oxidatively sensitive functionality demonstrates the unique advantage of using a simple amide substrate as a mild internal oxidant.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07341-z
Nature,2024-May,Climate velocities and species tracking in global mountain regions.,"Mountain ranges contain high concentrations of endemic species and are indispensable refugia for lowland species that are facing anthropogenic climate change<sup>1,2</sup>. Forecasting biodiversity redistribution hinges on assessing whether species can track shifting isotherms as the climate warms<sup>3,4</sup>. However, a global analysis of the velocities of isotherm shifts along elevation gradients is hindered by the scarcity of weather stations in mountainous regions<sup>5</sup>. Here we address this issue by mapping the lapse rate of temperature (LRT) across mountain regions globally, both by using satellite data (SLRT) and by using the laws of thermodynamics to account for water vapour<sup>6</sup> (that is, the moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALRT)). By dividing the rate of surface warming from 1971 to 2020 by either the SLRT or the MALRT, we provide maps of vertical isotherm shift velocities. We identify 17 mountain regions with exceptionally high vertical isotherm shift velocities (greater than 11.67 m per year for the SLRT; greater than 8.25 m per year for the MALRT), predominantly in dry areas but also in wet regions with shallow lapse rates; for example, northern Sumatra, the Brazilian highlands and southern Africa. By linking these velocities to the velocities of species range shifts, we report instances of close tracking in mountains with lower climate velocities. However, many species lag behind, suggesting that range shift dynamics would persist even if we managed to curb climate-change trajectories. Our findings are key for devising global conservation strategies, particularly in the 17 high-velocity mountain regions that we have identified.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07264-9
Nature,2024-May,Long-term continuous ammonia electrosynthesis.,"Ammonia is crucial as a fertilizer and in the chemical industry and is considered to be a carbon-free fuel<sup>1</sup>. Ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrogen under ambient conditions offers an attractive alternative to the Haber-Bosch process<sup>2,3</sup>, and lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction represents a promising approach to continuous-flow ammonia electrosynthesis, coupling nitrogen reduction with hydrogen oxidation<sup>4</sup>. However, tetrahydrofuran, which is commonly used as a solvent, impedes long-term ammonia production owing to polymerization and volatility problems. Here we show that a chain-ether-based electrolyte enables long-term continuous ammonia synthesis. We find that a chain-ether-based solvent exhibits non-polymerization properties and a high boiling point (162 °C) and forms a compact solid-electrolyte interphase layer on the gas diffusion electrode, facilitating ammonia release in the gas phase and ensuring electrolyte stability. We demonstrate 300 h of continuous operation in a flow electrolyser with a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> electrode at 1 bar pressure and room temperature, and achieve a current-to-ammonia efficiency of 64 ± 1% with a gas-phase ammonia content of approximately 98%. Our results highlight the crucial role of the solvent in long-term continuous ammonia synthesis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07276-5
Nature,2024-May,Structural insights into vesicular monoamine storage and drug interactions.,"Biogenic monoamines-vital transmitters orchestrating neurological, endocrinal and immunological functions<sup>1-5</sup>-are stored in secretory vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) for controlled quantal release<sup>6,7</sup>. Harnessing proton antiport, VMATs enrich monoamines around 10,000-fold and sequester neurotoxicants to protect neurons<sup>8-10</sup>. VMATs are targeted by an arsenal of therapeutic drugs and imaging agents to treat and monitor neurodegenerative disorders, hypertension and drug addiction<sup>1,8,11-16</sup>. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these actions remain unclear. Here we report eight cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VMAT1 in unbound form and in complex with four monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and histamine), the Parkinsonism-inducing MPP<sup>+</sup>, the psychostimulant amphetamine and the antihypertensive drug reserpine. Reserpine binding captures a cytoplasmic-open conformation, whereas the other structures show a lumenal-open conformation stabilized by extensive gating interactions. The favoured transition to this lumenal-open state contributes to monoamine accumulation, while protonation facilitates the cytoplasmic-open transition and concurrently prevents monoamine binding to avoid unintended depletion. Monoamines and neurotoxicants share a binding pocket that possesses polar sites for specificity and a wrist-and-fist shape for versatility. Variations in this pocket explain substrate preferences across the SLC18 family. Overall, these structural insights and supporting functional studies elucidate the mechanism of vesicular monoamine transport and provide the basis to develop therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and substance abuse.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07290-7
Nature,2024-May,Time-resolved cryo-EM of G-protein activation by a GPCR.,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate heterotrimeric G proteins by stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange in the Gα subunit<sup>1</sup>. To visualize this mechanism, we developed a time-resolved cryo-EM approach that examines the progression of ensembles of pre-steady-state intermediates of a GPCR-G-protein complex. By monitoring the transitions of the stimulatory G<sub>s</sub> protein in complex with the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor at short sequential time points after GTP addition, we identified the conformational trajectory underlying G-protein activation and functional dissociation from the receptor. Twenty structures generated from sequential overlapping particle subsets along this trajectory, compared to control structures, provide a high-resolution description of the order of main events driving G-protein activation in response to GTP binding. Structural changes propagate from the nucleotide-binding pocket and extend through the GTPase domain, enacting alterations to Gα switch regions and the α5 helix that weaken the G-protein-receptor interface. Molecular dynamics simulations with late structures in the cryo-EM trajectory support that enhanced ordering of GTP on closure of the α-helical domain against the nucleotide-bound Ras-homology domain correlates with α5 helix destabilization and eventual dissociation of the G protein from the GPCR. These findings also highlight the potential of time-resolved cryo-EM as a tool for mechanistic dissection of GPCR signalling events.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07153-1
Nature,2024-May,Structures and activation mechanism of the Gabija anti-phage system.,"Prokaryotes have evolved intricate innate immune systems against phage infection<sup>1-7</sup>. Gabija is a highly widespread prokaryotic defence system that consists of two components, GajA and GajB<sup>8</sup>. GajA functions as a DNA endonuclease that is inactive in the presence of ATP<sup>9</sup>. Here, to explore how the Gabija system is activated for anti-phage defence, we report its cryo-electron microscopy structures in five states, including apo GajA, GajA in complex with DNA, GajA bound by ATP, apo GajA-GajB, and GajA-GajB in complex with ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. GajA is a rhombus-shaped tetramer with its ATPase domain clustered at the centre and the topoisomerase-primase (Toprim) domain located peripherally. ATP binding at the ATPase domain stabilizes the insertion region within the ATPase domain, keeping the Toprim domain in a closed state. Upon ATP depletion by phages, the Toprim domain opens to bind and cleave the DNA substrate. GajB, which docks on GajA, is activated by the cleaved DNA, ultimately leading to prokaryotic cell death. Our study presents a mechanistic landscape of Gabija activation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07270-x
Nature,2024-May,The molecular basis of sugar detection by an insect taste receptor.,"Animals crave sugars because of their energy potential and the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Yet all sugars are not metabolically equivalent, requiring mechanisms to detect and differentiate between chemically similar sweet substances. Insects use a family of ionotropic gustatory receptors to discriminate sugars<sup>1</sup>, each of which is selectively activated by specific sweet molecules<sup>2-6</sup>. Here, to gain insight into the molecular basis of sugar selectivity, we determined structures of Gr9, a gustatory receptor from the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmGr9), in the absence and presence of its sole activating ligand, D-fructose. These structures, along with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, illustrate how D-fructose is enveloped by a ligand-binding pocket that precisely matches the overall shape and pattern of chemical groups in D-fructose. However, our computational docking and experimental binding assays revealed that other sugars also bind BmGr9, yet they are unable to activate the receptor. We determined the structure of BmGr9 in complex with one such non-activating sugar, L-sorbose. Although both sugars bind a similar position, only D-fructose is capable of engaging a bridge of two conserved aromatic residues that connects the pocket to the pore helix, inducing a conformational change that allows the ion-conducting pore to open. Thus, chemical specificity does not depend solely on the selectivity of the ligand-binding pocket, but it is an emergent property arising from a combination of receptor-ligand interactions and allosteric coupling. Our results support a model whereby coarse receptor tuning is derived from the size and chemical characteristics of the pocket, whereas fine-tuning of receptor activation is achieved through the selective engagement of an allosteric pathway that regulates ion conduction.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07255-w
Nature,2024-May,A recently quenched galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang.,"Local and low-redshift (z < 3) galaxies are known to broadly follow a bimodal distribution: actively star-forming galaxies with relatively stable star-formation rates and passive systems. These two populations are connected by galaxies in relatively slow transition. By contrast, theory predicts that star formation was stochastic at early cosmic times and in low-mass systems<sup>1-4</sup>. These galaxies transitioned rapidly between starburst episodes and phases of suppressed star formation, potentially even causing temporary quiescence-so-called mini-quenching events<sup>5,6</sup>. However, the regime of star-formation burstiness is observationally highly unconstrained. Directly observing mini-quenched galaxies in the primordial Universe is therefore of utmost importance to constrain models of galaxy formation and transformation<sup>7,8</sup>. Early quenched galaxies have been identified out to redshift z < 5 (refs. <sup>9-12</sup>) and these are all found to be massive (M<sub>⋆</sub> > 10<sup>10</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) and relatively old. Here we report a (mini-)quenched galaxy at z = 7.3, when the Universe was only 700 Myr old. The JWST/NIRSpec spectrum is very blue (U-V = 0.16 ± 0.03 mag) but exhibits a Balmer break and no nebular emission lines. The galaxy experienced a short starburst followed by rapid quenching; its stellar mass (4-6 × 10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) falls in a range that is sensitive to various feedback mechanisms, which can result in perhaps only temporary quenching.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07227-0
Nature,2024-Apr,Graphene nanoribbons grown in hBN stacks for high-performance electronics.,"Van der Waals encapsulation of two-dimensional materials in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) stacks is a promising way to create ultrahigh-performance electronic devices<sup>1-4</sup>. However, contemporary approaches for achieving van der Waals encapsulation, which involve artificial layer stacking using mechanical transfer techniques, are difficult to control, prone to contamination and unscalable. Here we report the transfer-free direct growth of high-quality graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in hBN stacks. The as-grown embedded GNRs exhibit highly desirable features being ultralong (up to 0.25 mm), ultranarrow (<5 nm) and homochiral with zigzag edges. Our atomistic simulations show that the mechanism underlying the embedded growth involves ultralow GNR friction when sliding between AA'-stacked hBN layers. Using the grown structures, we demonstrate the transfer-free fabrication of embedded GNR field-effect devices that exhibit excellent performance at room temperature with mobilities of up to 4,600 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and on-off ratios of up to 10<sup>6</sup>. This paves the way for the bottom-up fabrication of high-performance electronic devices based on embedded layered materials.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07243-0
Nature,2024-Apr,Evidence for chiral graviton modes in fractional quantum Hall liquids.,"Exotic physics could emerge from interplay between geometry and correlation. In fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states<sup>1</sup>, novel collective excitations called chiral graviton modes (CGMs) are proposed as quanta of fluctuations of an internal quantum metric under a quantum geometry description<sup>2-5</sup>. Such modes are condensed-matter analogues of gravitons that are hypothetical spin-2 bosons. They are characterized by polarized states with chirality<sup>6-8</sup> of +2 or -2, and energy gaps coinciding with the fundamental neutral collective excitations (namely, magnetorotons<sup>9,10</sup>) in the long-wavelength limit. However, CGMs remain experimentally inaccessible. Here we observe chiral spin-2 long-wavelength magnetorotons using inelastic scattering of circularly polarized lights, providing strong evidence for CGMs in FQH liquids. At filling factor v = 1/3, a gapped mode identified as the long-wavelength magnetoroton emerges under a specific polarization scheme corresponding to angular momentum S = -2, which persists at extremely long wavelength. Remarkably, the mode chirality remains -2 at v = 2/5 but becomes the opposite at v = 2/3 and 3/5. The modes have characteristic energies and sharp peaks with marked temperature and filling-factor dependence, corroborating the assignment of long-wavelength magnetorotons. The observations capture the essentials of CGMs and support the FQH geometrical description, paving the way to unveil rich physics of quantum metric effects in topological correlated systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07201-w
Nature,2024-Apr,Targeting DCAF5 suppresses SMARCB1-mutant cancer by stabilizing SWI/SNF.,"Whereas oncogenes can potentially be inhibited with small molecules, the loss of tumour suppressors is more common and is problematic because the tumour-suppressor proteins are no longer present to be targeted. Notable examples include SMARCB1-mutant cancers, which are highly lethal malignancies driven by the inactivation of a subunit of SWI/SNF (also known as BAF) chromatin-remodelling complexes. Here, to generate mechanistic insights into the consequences of SMARCB1 mutation and to identify vulnerabilities, we contributed 14 SMARCB1-mutant cell lines to a near genome-wide CRISPR screen as part of the Cancer Dependency Map Project<sup>1-3</sup>. We report that the little-studied gene DDB1-CUL4-associated factor 5 (DCAF5) is required for the survival of SMARCB1-mutant cancers. We show that DCAF5 has a quality-control function for SWI/SNF complexes and promotes the degradation of incompletely assembled SWI/SNF complexes in the absence of SMARCB1. After depletion of DCAF5, SMARCB1-deficient SWI/SNF complexes reaccumulate, bind to target loci and restore SWI/SNF-mediated gene expression to levels that are sufficient to reverse the cancer state, including in vivo. Consequently, cancer results not from the loss of SMARCB1 function per se, but rather from DCAF5-mediated degradation of SWI/SNF complexes. These data indicate that therapeutic targeting of ubiquitin-mediated quality-control factors may effectively reverse the malignant state of some cancers driven by disruption of tumour suppressor complexes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07250-1
Nature,2024-Apr,Structural basis of exoribonuclease-mediated mRNA transcription termination.,"Efficient termination is required for robust gene transcription. Eukaryotic organisms use a conserved exoribonuclease-mediated mechanism to terminate the mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II)<sup>1-5</sup>. Here we report two cryogenic electron microscopy structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II pre-termination transcription complexes bound to the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease Rat1 and its partner Rai1. Our structures show that Rat1 displaces the elongation factor Spt5 to dock at the Pol II stalk domain. Rat1 shields the RNA exit channel of Pol II, guides the nascent RNA towards its active centre and stacks three nucleotides at the 5' terminus of the nascent RNA. The structures further show that Rat1 rotates towards Pol II as it shortens RNA. Our results provide the structural mechanism for the Rat1-mediated termination of mRNA transcription by Pol II in yeast and the exoribonuclease-mediated termination of mRNA transcription in other eukaryotes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07240-3
Nature,2024-Apr,The HEAT repeat protein HPO-27 is a lysosome fission factor.,"Lysosomes are degradation and signalling centres crucial for homeostasis, development and ageing<sup>1</sup>. To meet diverse cellular demands, lysosomes remodel their morphology and function through constant fusion and fission<sup>2,3</sup>. Little is known about the molecular basis of fission. Here we identify HPO-27, a conserved HEAT repeat protein, as a lysosome scission factor in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of HPO-27 impairs lysosome fission and leads to an excessive tubular network that ultimately collapses. HPO-27 and its human homologue MROH1 are recruited to lysosomes by RAB-7 and enriched at scission sites. Super-resolution imaging, negative-staining electron microscopy and in vitro reconstitution assays reveal that HPO-27 and MROH1 self-assemble to mediate the constriction and scission of lysosomal tubules in worms and mammalian cells, respectively, and assemble to sever supported membrane tubes in vitro. Loss of HPO-27 affects lysosomal morphology, integrity and degradation activity, which impairs animal development and longevity. Thus, HPO-27 and MROH1 act as self-assembling scission factors to maintain lysosomal homeostasis and function.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07249-8
Nature,2024-Apr,Interchain-expanded extra-large-pore zeolites.,"Stable aluminosilicate zeolites with extra-large pores that are open through rings of more than 12 tetrahedra could be used to process molecules larger than those currently manageable in zeolite materials. However, until very recently<sup>1-3</sup>, they proved elusive. In analogy to the interlayer expansion of layered zeolite precursors<sup>4,5</sup>, we report a strategy that yields thermally and hydrothermally stable silicates by expansion of a one-dimensional silicate chain with an intercalated silylating agent that separates and connects the chains. As a result, zeolites with extra-large pores delimited by 20, 16 and 16 Si tetrahedra along the three crystallographic directions are obtained. The as-made interchain-expanded zeolite contains dangling Si-CH<sub>3</sub> groups that, by calcination, connect to each other, resulting in a true, fully connected (except possible defects) three-dimensional zeolite framework with a very low density. Additionally, it features triple four-ring units not seen before in any type of zeolite. The silicate expansion-condensation approach we report may be amenable to further extra-large-pore zeolite formation. Ti can be introduced in this zeolite, leading to a catalyst that is active in liquid-phase alkene oxidations involving bulky molecules, which shows promise in the industrially relevant clean production of propylene oxide using cumene hydroperoxide as an oxidant.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07194-6
Nature,2024-Apr,A global timekeeping problem postponed by global warming.,"The historical association of time with the rotation of Earth has meant that Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) closely follows this rotation<sup>1</sup>. Because the rotation rate is not constant, UTC contains discontinuities (leap seconds), which complicates its use in computer networks<sup>2</sup>. Since 1972, all UTC discontinuities have required that a leap second be added<sup>3</sup>. Here we show that increased melting of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, measured by satellite gravity<sup>4,5</sup>, has decreased the angular velocity of Earth more rapidly than before. Removing this effect from the observed angular velocity shows that since 1972, the angular velocity of the liquid core of Earth has been decreasing at a constant rate that has steadily increased the angular velocity of the rest of the Earth. Extrapolating the trends for the core and other relevant phenomena to predict future Earth orientation shows that UTC as now defined will require a negative discontinuity by 2029. This will pose an unprecedented problem for computer network timing and may require changes in UTC to be made earlier than is planned. If polar ice melting had not recently accelerated, this problem would occur 3 years earlier: global warming is already affecting global timekeeping.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07170-0
Nature,2024-Apr,"A three-dimensional liquid diode for soft, integrated permeable electronics.","Wearable electronics with great breathability enable a comfortable wearing experience and facilitate continuous biosignal monitoring over extended periods<sup>1-3</sup>. However, current research on permeable electronics is predominantly at the stage of electrode and substrate development, which is far behind practical applications with comprehensive integration with diverse electronic components (for example, circuitry, electronics, encapsulation)<sup>4-8</sup>. Achieving permeability and multifunctionality in a singular, integrated wearable electronic system remains a formidable challenge. Here we present a general strategy for integrated moisture-permeable wearable electronics based on three-dimensional liquid diode (3D LD) configurations. By constructing spatially heterogeneous wettability, the 3D LD unidirectionally self-pumps the sweat from the skin to the outlet at a maximum flow rate of 11.6 ml cm<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, 4,000 times greater than the physiological sweat rate during exercise, presenting exceptional skin-friendliness, user comfort and stable signal-reading behaviour even under sweating conditions. A detachable design incorporating a replaceable vapour/sweat-discharging substrate enables the reuse of soft circuitry/electronics, increasing its sustainability and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrated this fundamental technology in both advanced skin-integrated electronics and textile-integrated electronics, highlighting its potential for scalable, user-friendly wearable devices.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07161-1
Nature,2024-Apr,Depleting myeloid-biased haematopoietic stem cells rejuvenates aged immunity.,"Ageing of the immune system is characterized by decreased lymphopoiesis and adaptive immunity, and increased inflammation and myeloid pathologies<sup>1,2</sup>. Age-related changes in populations of self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to underlie these phenomena<sup>3</sup>. During youth, HSCs with balanced output of lymphoid and myeloid cells (bal-HSCs) predominate over HSCs with myeloid-biased output (my-HSCs), thereby promoting the lymphopoiesis required for initiating adaptive immune responses, while limiting the production of myeloid cells, which can be pro-inflammatory<sup>4</sup>. Ageing is associated with increased proportions of my-HSCs, resulting in decreased lymphopoiesis and increased myelopoiesis<sup>3,5,6</sup>. Transfer of bal-HSCs results in abundant lymphoid and myeloid cells, a stable phenotype that is retained after secondary transfer; my-HSCs also retain their patterns of production after secondary transfer<sup>5</sup>. The origin and potential interconversion of these two subsets is still unclear. If they are separate subsets postnatally, it might be possible to reverse the ageing phenotype by eliminating my-HSCs in aged mice. Here we demonstrate that antibody-mediated depletion of my-HSCs in aged mice restores characteristic features of a more youthful immune system, including increasing common lymphocyte progenitors, naive T cells and B cells, while decreasing age-related markers of immune decline. Depletion of my-HSCs in aged mice improves primary and secondary adaptive immune responses to viral infection. These findings may have relevance to the understanding and intervention of diseases exacerbated or caused by dominance of the haematopoietic system by my-HSCs.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07238-x
Nature,2024-Apr,Heat and desiccation tolerances predict bee abundance under climate change.,"Climate change could pose an urgent threat to pollinators, with critical ecological and economic consequences. However, for most insect pollinator species, we lack the long-term data and mechanistic evidence that are necessary to identify climate-driven declines and predict future trends. Here we document 16 years of abundance patterns for a hyper-diverse bee assemblage<sup>1</sup> in a warming and drying region<sup>2</sup>, link bee declines with experimentally determined heat and desiccation tolerances, and use climate sensitivity models to project bee communities into the future. Aridity strongly predicted bee abundance for 71% of 665 bee populations (species × ecosystem combinations). Bee taxa that best tolerated heat and desiccation increased the most over time. Models forecasted declines for 46% of species and predicted more homogeneous communities dominated by drought-tolerant taxa, even while total bee abundance may remain unchanged. Such community reordering could reduce pollination services, because diverse bee assemblages typically maximize pollination for plant communities<sup>3</sup>. Larger-bodied bees also dominated under intermediate to high aridity, identifying body size as a valuable trait for understanding how climate-driven shifts in bee communities influence pollination<sup>4</sup>. We provide evidence that climate change directly threatens bee diversity, indicating that bee conservation efforts should account for the stress of aridity on bee physiology.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07241-2
Nature,2024-Apr,Single-cell multiplex chromatin and RNA interactions in ageing human brain.,"Dynamically organized chromatin complexes often involve multiplex chromatin interactions and sometimes chromatin-associated RNA<sup>1-3</sup>. Chromatin complex compositions change during cellular differentiation and ageing, and are expected to be highly heterogeneous among terminally differentiated single cells<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we introduce the multinucleic acid interaction mapping in single cells (MUSIC) technique for concurrent profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression and RNA-chromatin associations within individual nuclei. When applied to 14 human frontal cortex samples from older donors, MUSIC delineated diverse cortical cell types and states. We observed that nuclei exhibiting fewer short-range chromatin interactions were correlated with both an 'older' transcriptomic signature and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Furthermore, the cell type exhibiting chromatin contacts between cis expression quantitative trait loci and a promoter tends to be that in which these cis expression quantitative trait loci specifically affect the expression of their target gene. In addition, female cortical cells exhibit highly heterogeneous interactions between XIST non-coding RNA and chromosome X, along with diverse spatial organizations of the X chromosomes. MUSIC presents a potent tool for exploration of chromatin architecture and transcription at cellular resolution in complex tissues.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07239-w
Nature,2024-Apr,Revealing uncertainty in the status of biodiversity change.,"Biodiversity faces unprecedented threats from rapid global change<sup>1</sup>. Signals of biodiversity change come from time-series abundance datasets for thousands of species over large geographic and temporal scales. Analyses of these biodiversity datasets have pointed to varied trends in abundance, including increases and decreases. However, these analyses have not fully accounted for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic structures in the data. Here, using a new statistical framework, we show across ten high-profile biodiversity datasets<sup>2-11</sup> that increases and decreases under existing approaches vanish once spatial, temporal and phylogenetic structures are accounted for. This is a consequence of existing approaches severely underestimating trend uncertainty and sometimes misestimating the trend direction. Under our revised average abundance trends that appropriately recognize uncertainty, we failed to observe a single increasing or decreasing trend at 95% credible intervals in our ten datasets. This emphasizes how little is known about biodiversity change across vast spatial and taxonomic scales. Despite this uncertainty at vast scales, we reveal improved local-scale prediction accuracy by accounting for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic structures. Improved prediction offers hope of estimating biodiversity change at policy-relevant scales, guiding adaptive conservation responses.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07236-z
Nature,2024-Apr,A brainstem-hypothalamus neuronal circuit reduces feeding upon heat exposure.,"Empirical evidence suggests that heat exposure reduces food intake. However, the neurocircuit architecture and the signalling mechanisms that form an associative interface between sensory and metabolic modalities remain unknown, despite primary thermoceptive neurons in the pontine parabrachial nucleus becoming well characterized<sup>1</sup>. Tanycytes are a specialized cell type along the wall of the third ventricle<sup>2</sup> that bidirectionally transport hormones and signalling molecules between the brain's parenchyma and ventricular system<sup>3-8</sup>. Here we show that tanycytes are activated upon acute thermal challenge and are necessary to reduce food intake afterwards. Virus-mediated gene manipulation and circuit mapping showed that thermosensing glutamatergic neurons of the parabrachial nucleus innervate tanycytes either directly or through second-order hypothalamic neurons. Heat-dependent Fos expression in tanycytes suggested their ability to produce signalling molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Instead of discharging VEGFA into the cerebrospinal fluid for a systemic effect, VEGFA was released along the parenchymal processes of tanycytes in the arcuate nucleus. VEGFA then increased the spike threshold of Flt1-expressing dopamine and agouti-related peptide (Agrp)-containing neurons, thus priming net anorexigenic output. Indeed, both acute heat and the chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic parabrachial neurons at thermoneutrality reduced food intake for hours, in a manner that is sensitive to both Vegfa loss-of-function and blockage of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2)-dependent exocytosis from tanycytes. Overall, we define a multimodal neurocircuit in which tanycytes link parabrachial sensory relay to the long-term enforcement of a metabolic code.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07232-3
Nature,2024-Apr,TRBC1-targeting antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of T cell cancers.,"Antibody and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-mediated targeted therapies have improved survival in patients with solid and haematologic malignancies<sup>1-9</sup>. Adults with T cell leukaemias and lymphomas, collectively called T cell cancers, have short survival<sup>10,11</sup> and lack such targeted therapies. Thus, T cell cancers particularly warrant the development of CAR T cells and antibodies to improve patient outcomes. Preclinical studies showed that targeting T cell receptor β-chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) can kill cancerous T cells while preserving sufficient healthy T cells to maintain immunity<sup>12</sup>, making TRBC1 an attractive target to treat T cell cancers. However, the first-in-human clinical trial of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells reported a low response rate and unexplained loss of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells<sup>13,14</sup>. Here we demonstrate that CAR T cells are lost due to killing by the patient's normal T cells, reducing their efficacy. To circumvent this issue, we developed an antibody-drug conjugate that could kill TRBC1<sup>+</sup> cancer cells in vitro and cure human T cell cancers in mouse models. The anti-TRBC1 antibody-drug conjugate may provide an optimal format for TRBC1 targeting and produce superior responses in patients with T cell cancers.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07233-2
Nature,2024-Apr,Formation of memory assemblies through the DNA-sensing TLR9 pathway.,"As hippocampal neurons respond to diverse types of information<sup>1</sup>, a subset assembles into microcircuits representing a memory<sup>2</sup>. Those neurons typically undergo energy-intensive molecular adaptations, occasionally resulting in transient DNA damage<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we found discrete clusters of excitatory hippocampal CA1 neurons with persistent double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks, nuclear envelope ruptures and perinuclear release of histone and dsDNA fragments hours after learning. Following these early events, some neurons acquired an inflammatory phenotype involving activation of TLR9 signalling and accumulation of centrosomal DNA damage repair complexes<sup>6</sup>. Neuron-specific knockdown of Tlr9 impaired memory while blunting contextual fear conditioning-induced changes of gene expression in specific clusters of excitatory CA1 neurons. Notably, TLR9 had an essential role in centrosome function, including DNA damage repair, ciliogenesis and build-up of perineuronal nets. We demonstrate a novel cascade of learning-induced molecular events in discrete neuronal clusters undergoing dsDNA damage and TLR9-mediated repair, resulting in their recruitment to memory circuits. With compromised TLR9 function, this fundamental memory mechanism becomes a gateway to genomic instability and cognitive impairments implicated in accelerated senescence, psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Maintaining the integrity of TLR9 inflammatory signalling thus emerges as a promising preventive strategy for neurocognitive deficits.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07220-7
Nature,2024-Apr,CGRP sensory neurons promote tissue healing via neutrophils and macrophages.,"The immune system has a critical role in orchestrating tissue healing. As a result, regenerative strategies that control immune components have proved effective<sup>1,2</sup>. This is particularly relevant when immune dysregulation that results from conditions such as diabetes or advanced age impairs tissue healing following injury<sup>2,3</sup>. Nociceptive sensory neurons have a crucial role as immunoregulators and exert both protective and harmful effects depending on the context<sup>4-12</sup>. However, how neuro-immune interactions affect tissue repair and regeneration following acute injury is unclear. Here we show that ablation of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 nociceptor impairs skin wound repair and muscle regeneration after acute tissue injury. Nociceptor endings grow into injured skin and muscle tissues and signal to immune cells through the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) during the healing process. CGRP acts via receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) on neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages to inhibit recruitment, accelerate death, enhance efferocytosis and polarize macrophages towards a pro-repair phenotype. The effects of CGRP on neutrophils and macrophages are mediated via thrombospondin-1 release and its subsequent autocrine and/or paracrine effects. In mice without nociceptors and diabetic mice with peripheral neuropathies, delivery of an engineered version of CGRP accelerated wound healing and promoted muscle regeneration. Harnessing neuro-immune interactions has potential to treat non-healing tissues in which dysregulated neuro-immune interactions impair tissue healing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07237-y
Nature,2024-Apr,The complex polyploid genome architecture of sugarcane.,"Sugarcane, the world's most harvested crop by tonnage, has shaped global history, trade and geopolitics, and is currently responsible for 80% of sugar production worldwide<sup>1</sup>. While traditional sugarcane breeding methods have effectively generated cultivars adapted to new environments and pathogens, sugar yield improvements have recently plateaued<sup>2</sup>. The cessation of yield gains may be due to limited genetic diversity within breeding populations, long breeding cycles and the complexity of its genome, the latter preventing breeders from taking advantage of the recent explosion of whole-genome sequencing that has benefited many other crops. Thus, modern sugarcane hybrids are the last remaining major crop without a reference-quality genome. Here we take a major step towards advancing sugarcane biotechnology by generating a polyploid reference genome for R570, a typical modern cultivar derived from interspecific hybridization between the domesticated species (Saccharum officinarum) and the wild species (Saccharum spontaneum). In contrast to the existing single haplotype ('monoploid') representation of R570, our 8.7 billion base assembly contains a complete representation of unique DNA sequences across the approximately 12 chromosome copies in this polyploid genome. Using this highly contiguous genome assembly, we filled a previously unsized gap within an R570 physical genetic map to describe the likely causal genes underlying the single-copy Bru1 brown rust resistance locus. This polyploid genome assembly with fine-grain descriptions of genome architecture and molecular targets for biotechnology will help accelerate molecular and transgenic breeding and adaptation of sugarcane to future environmental conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07231-4
Nature,2024-Apr,The hidden fitness of the male zebra finch courtship song.,"Vocal learning in songbirds is thought to have evolved through sexual selection, with female preference driving males to develop large and varied song repertoires<sup>1-3</sup>. However, many songbird species learn only a single song in their lifetime<sup>4</sup>. How sexual selection drives the evolution of single-song repertoires is not known. Here, by applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to the singing behaviour of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), we show that syllable spread in low-dimensional feature space explains how single songs function as honest indicators of fitness. We find that this Gestalt measure of behaviour captures the spectrotemporal distinctiveness of song syllables in zebra finches; that females strongly prefer songs that occupy more latent space; and that matching path lengths in low-dimensional space is difficult for young males. Our findings clarify how simple vocal repertoires may have evolved in songbirds and indicate divergent strategies for how sexual selection can shape vocal learning.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07207-4

Nature,2024-Apr,Dual quantum spin Hall insulator by density-tuned correlations in TaIrTe<sub>4</sub>.,"The convergence of topology and correlations represents a highly coveted realm in the pursuit of new quantum states of matter<sup>1</sup>. Introducing electron correlations to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator can lead to the emergence of a fractional topological insulator and other exotic time-reversal-symmetric topological order<sup>2-8</sup>, not possible in quantum Hall and Chern insulator systems. Here we report a new dual QSH insulator within the intrinsic monolayer crystal of TaIrTe<sub>4</sub>, arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations. At charge neutrality, monolayer TaIrTe<sub>4</sub> demonstrates the QSH insulator, manifesting enhanced nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conductance. After introducing electrons from charge neutrality, TaIrTe<sub>4</sub> shows metallic behaviour in only a small range of charge densities but quickly goes into a new insulating state, entirely unexpected on the basis of the single-particle band structure of TaIrTe<sub>4</sub>. This insulating state could arise from a strong electronic instability near the van Hove singularities, probably leading to a charge density wave (CDW). Remarkably, within this correlated insulating gap, we observe a resurgence of the QSH state. The observation of helical edge conduction in a CDW gap could bridge spin physics and charge orders. The discovery of a dual QSH insulator introduces a new method for creating topological flat minibands through CDW superlattices, which offer a promising platform for exploring time-reversal-symmetric fractional phases and electromagnetism<sup>2-4,9,10</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07211-8
Nature,2024-Apr,Rotating curved spacetime signatures from a giant quantum vortex.,"Gravity simulators<sup>1</sup> are laboratory systems in which small excitations such as sound<sup>2</sup> or surface waves<sup>3,4</sup> behave as fields propagating on a curved spacetime geometry. The analogy between gravity and fluids requires vanishing viscosity<sup>2-4</sup>, a feature naturally realized in superfluids such as liquid helium or cold atomic clouds<sup>5-8</sup>. Such systems have been successful in verifying key predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime<sup>7-11</sup>. In particular, quantum simulations of rotating curved spacetimes indicative of astrophysical black holes require the realization of an extensive vortex flow<sup>12</sup> in superfluid systems. Here we demonstrate that, despite the inherent instability of multiply quantized vortices<sup>13,14</sup>, a stationary giant quantum vortex can be stabilized in superfluid <sup>4</sup>He. Its compact core carries thousands of circulation quanta, prevailing over current limitations in other physical systems such as magnons<sup>5</sup>, atomic clouds<sup>6,7</sup> and polaritons<sup>15,16</sup>. We introduce a minimally invasive way to characterize the vortex flow<sup>17,18</sup> by exploiting the interaction of micrometre-scale waves on the superfluid interface with the background velocity field. Intricate wave-vortex interactions, including the detection of bound states and distinctive analogue black hole ringdown signatures, have been observed. These results open new avenues to explore quantum-to-classical vortex transitions and use superfluid helium as a finite-temperature quantum field theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes<sup>19</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07176-8
Nature,2024-Apr,Benchmarking highly entangled states on a 60-atom analogue quantum simulator.,"Quantum systems have entered a competitive regime in which classical computers must make approximations to represent highly entangled quantum states<sup>1,2</sup>. However, in this beyond-classically-exact regime, fidelity comparisons between quantum and classical systems have so far been limited to digital quantum devices<sup>2-5</sup>, and it remains unsolved how to estimate the actual entanglement content of experiments<sup>6</sup>. Here, we perform fidelity benchmarking and mixed-state entanglement estimation with a 60-atom analogue Rydberg quantum simulator, reaching a high-entanglement entropy regime in which exact classical simulation becomes impractical. Our benchmarking protocol involves extrapolation from comparisons against an approximate classical algorithm, introduced here, with varying entanglement limits. We then develop and demonstrate an estimator of the experimental mixed-state entanglement<sup>6</sup>, finding our experiment is competitive with state-of-the-art digital quantum devices performing random circuit evolution<sup>2-5</sup>. Finally, we compare the experimental fidelity against that achieved by various approximate classical algorithms, and find that only the algorithm we introduce is able to keep pace with the experiment on the classical hardware we use. Our results enable a new model for evaluating the ability of both analogue and digital quantum devices to generate entanglement in the beyond-classically-exact regime, and highlight the evolving divide between quantum and classical systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07173-x
Nature,2024-Apr,Motor neurons generate pose-targeted movements via proprioceptive sculpting.,"Motor neurons are the final common pathway<sup>1</sup> through which the brain controls movement of the body, forming the basic elements from which all movement is composed. Yet how a single motor neuron contributes to control during natural movement remains unclear. Here we anatomically and functionally characterize the individual roles of the motor neurons that control head movement in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Counterintuitively, we find that activity in a single motor neuron rotates the head in different directions, depending on the starting posture of the head, such that the head converges towards a pose determined by the identity of the stimulated motor neuron. A feedback model predicts that this convergent behaviour results from motor neuron drive interacting with proprioceptive feedback. We identify and genetically<sup>2</sup> suppress a single class of proprioceptive neuron<sup>3</sup> that changes the motor neuron-induced convergence as predicted by the feedback model. These data suggest a framework for how the brain controls movements: instead of directly generating movement in a given direction by activating a fixed set of motor neurons, the brain controls movements by adding bias to a continuing proprioceptive-motor loop.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07222-5
Nature,2024-Apr,Persistent interaction patterns across social media platforms and over time.,"Growing concern surrounds the impact of social media platforms on public discourse<sup>1-4</sup> and their influence on social dynamics<sup>5-9</sup>, especially in the context of toxicity<sup>10-12</sup>. Here, to better understand these phenomena, we use a comparative approach to isolate human behavioural patterns across multiple social media platforms. In particular, we analyse conversations in different online communities, focusing on identifying consistent patterns of toxic content. Drawing from an extensive dataset that spans eight platforms over 34 years-from Usenet to contemporary social media-our findings show consistent conversation patterns and user behaviour, irrespective of the platform, topic or time. Notably, although long conversations consistently exhibit higher toxicity, toxic language does not invariably discourage people from participating in a conversation, and toxicity does not necessarily escalate as discussions evolve. Our analysis suggests that debates and contrasting sentiments among users significantly contribute to more intense and hostile discussions. Moreover, the persistence of these patterns across three decades, despite changes in platforms and societal norms, underscores the pivotal role of human behaviour in shaping online discourse.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07229-y
Nature,2024-Apr,Role of IL-27 in Epstein-Barr virus infection revealed by IL-27RA deficiency.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can engender severe B cell lymphoproliferative diseases<sup>1,2</sup>. The primary infection is often asymptomatic or causes infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disorder<sup>3</sup>. Selective vulnerability to EBV has been reported in association with inherited mutations impairing T cell immunity to EBV<sup>4</sup>. Here we report biallelic loss-of-function variants in IL27RA that underlie an acute and severe primary EBV infection with a nevertheless favourable outcome requiring a minimal treatment. One mutant allele (rs201107107) was enriched in the Finnish population (minor allele frequency = 0.0068) and carried a high risk of severe infectious mononucleosis when homozygous. IL27RA encodes the IL-27 receptor alpha subunit<sup>5,6</sup>. In the absence of IL-27RA, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by IL-27 is abolished in T cells. In in vitro studies, IL-27 exerts a synergistic effect on T-cell-receptor-dependent T cell proliferation<sup>7</sup> that is deficient in cells from the patients, leading to impaired expansion of potent anti-EBV effector cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. IL-27 is produced by EBV-infected B lymphocytes and an IL-27RA-IL-27 autocrine loop is required for the maintenance of EBV-transformed B cells. This potentially explains the eventual favourable outcome of the EBV-induced viral disease in patients with IL-27RA deficiency. Furthermore, we identified neutralizing anti-IL-27 autoantibodies in most individuals who developed sporadic infectious mononucleosis and chronic EBV infection. These results demonstrate the critical role of IL-27RA-IL-27 in immunity to EBV, but also the hijacking of this defence by EBV to promote the expansion of infected transformed B cells.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07213-6
Nature,2024-Apr,Transcription-replication conflicts underlie sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.,"An important advance in cancer therapy has been the development of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for the treatment of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancers<sup>1-6</sup>. PARP inhibitors trap PARPs on DNA. The trapped PARPs are thought to block replisome progression, leading to formation of DNA double-strand breaks that require HR for repair<sup>7</sup>. Here we show that PARP1 functions together with TIMELESS and TIPIN to protect the replisome in early S phase from transcription-replication conflicts. Furthermore, the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors with HR deficiency is due to an inability to repair DNA damage caused by transcription-replication conflicts, rather than by trapped PARPs. Along these lines, inhibiting transcription elongation in early S phase rendered HR-deficient cells resistant to PARP inhibitors and depleting PARP1 by small-interfering RNA was synthetic lethal with HR deficiency. Thus, inhibiting PARP1 enzymatic activity may suffice for treatment efficacy in HR-deficient settings.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07217-2
Nature,2024-Apr,Structure and assembly of a bacterial gasdermin pore.,"In response to pathogen infection, gasdermin (GSDM) proteins form membrane pores that induce a host cell death process called pyroptosis<sup>1-3</sup>. Studies of human and mouse GSDM pores have revealed the functions and architectures of assemblies comprising 24 to 33 protomers<sup>4-9</sup>, but the mechanism and evolutionary origin of membrane targeting and GSDM pore formation remain unknown. Here we determine a structure of a bacterial GSDM (bGSDM) pore and define a conserved mechanism of pore assembly. Engineering a panel of bGSDMs for site-specific proteolytic activation, we demonstrate that diverse bGSDMs form distinct pore sizes that range from smaller mammalian-like assemblies to exceptionally large pores containing more than 50 protomers. We determine a cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Vitiosangium bGSDM in an active 'slinky'-like oligomeric conformation and analyse bGSDM pores in a native lipid environment to create an atomic-level model of a full 52-mer bGSDM pore. Combining our structural analysis with molecular dynamics simulations and cellular assays, our results support a stepwise model of GSDM pore assembly and suggest that a covalently bound palmitoyl can leave a hydrophobic sheath and insert into the membrane before formation of the membrane-spanning β-strand regions. These results reveal the diversity of GSDM pores found in nature and explain the function of an ancient post-translational modification in enabling programmed host cell death.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07216-3
Nature,2024-Apr,Venous-plexus-associated lymphoid hubs support meningeal humoral immunity.,"There is increasing interest in how immune cells in the meninges-the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord-contribute to homeostasis and disease in the central nervous system<sup>1,2</sup>. The outer layer of the meninges, the dura mater, has recently been described to contain both innate and adaptive immune cells, and functions as a site for B cell development<sup>3-6</sup>. Here we identify organized lymphoid structures that protect fenestrated vasculature in the dura mater. The most elaborate of these dural-associated lymphoid tissues (DALT) surrounded the rostral-rhinal confluence of the sinuses and included lymphatic vessels. We termed this structure, which interfaces with the skull bone marrow and a comparable venous plexus at the skull base, the rostral-rhinal venolymphatic hub. Immune aggregates were present in DALT during homeostasis and expanded with age or after challenge with systemic or nasal antigens. DALT contain germinal centre B cells and support the generation of somatically mutated, antibody-producing cells in response to a nasal pathogen challenge. Inhibition of lymphocyte entry into the rostral-rhinal hub at the time of nasal viral challenge abrogated the generation of germinal centre B cells and class-switched plasma cells, as did perturbation of B-T cell interactions. These data demonstrate a lymphoid structure around vasculature in the dura mater that can sample antigens and rapidly support humoral immune responses after local pathogen challenge.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07202-9
Nature,2024-Apr,Proteome-scale discovery of protein degradation and stabilization effectors.,"Targeted protein degradation and stabilization are promising therapeutic modalities because of their potency, versatility and their potential to expand the druggable target space<sup>1,2</sup>. However, only a few of the hundreds of E3 ligases and deubiquitinases in the human proteome have been harnessed for this purpose, which substantially limits the potential of the approach. Moreover, there may be other protein classes that could be exploited for protein stabilization or degradation<sup>3-5</sup>, but there are currently no methods that can identify such effector proteins in a scalable and unbiased manner. Here we established a synthetic proteome-scale platform to functionally identify human proteins that can promote the degradation or stabilization of a target protein in a proximity-dependent manner. Our results reveal that the human proteome contains a large cache of effectors of protein stability. The approach further enabled us to comprehensively compare the activities of human E3 ligases and deubiquitinases, identify and characterize non-canonical protein degraders and stabilizers and establish that effectors have vastly different activities against diverse targets. Notably, the top degraders were more potent against multiple therapeutically relevant targets than the currently used E3 ligases cereblon and VHL. Our study provides a functional catalogue of stability effectors for targeted protein degradation and stabilization and highlights the potential of induced proximity screens for the discovery of new proximity-dependent protein modulators.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07224-3
Nature,2024-Apr,Adaptive foraging behaviours in the Horn of Africa during Toba supereruption.,"Although modern humans left Africa multiple times over 100,000 years ago, those broadly ancestral to non-Africans dispersed less than 100,000 years ago<sup>1</sup>. Most models hold that these events occurred through green corridors created during humid periods because arid intervals constrained population movements<sup>2</sup>. Here we report an archaeological site-Shinfa-Metema 1, in the lowlands of northwest Ethiopia, with Youngest Toba Tuff cryptotephra dated to around 74,000 years ago-that provides early and rare evidence of intensive riverine-based foraging aided by the likely adoption of the bow and arrow. The diet included a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic animals. Stable oxygen isotopes from fossil mammal teeth and ostrich eggshell show that the site was occupied during a period of high seasonal aridity. The unusual abundance of fish suggests that capture occurred in the ever smaller and shallower waterholes of a seasonal river during a long dry season, revealing flexible adaptations to challenging climatic conditions during the Middle Stone Age. Adaptive foraging along dry-season waterholes would have transformed seasonal rivers into 'blue highway' corridors, potentially facilitating an out-of-Africa dispersal and suggesting that the event was not restricted to times of humid climates. The behavioural flexibility required to survive seasonally arid conditions in general, and the apparent short-term effects of the Toba supereruption in particular were probably key to the most recent dispersal and subsequent worldwide expansion of modern humans.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07208-3
Nature,2024-Apr,Compensatory evolution in NusG improves fitness of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis.,"Drug-resistant bacteria are emerging as a global threat, despite frequently being less fit than their drug-susceptible ancestors<sup>1-8</sup>. Here we sought to define the mechanisms that drive or buffer the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance (RifR) in the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase (RNAP) and is a cornerstone of modern short-course tuberculosis therapy<sup>9,10</sup>. However, RifR Mtb accounts for one-quarter of all deaths due to drug-resistant bacteria<sup>11,12</sup>. We took a comparative functional genomics approach to define processes that are differentially vulnerable to CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) inhibition in RifR Mtb. Among other hits, we found that the universally conserved transcription factor NusG is crucial for the fitness of RifR Mtb. In contrast to its role in Escherichia coli, Mtb NusG has an essential RNAP pro-pausing function mediated by distinct contacts with RNAP and the DNA<sup>13</sup>. We find this pro-pausing NusG-RNAP interface to be under positive selection in clinical RifR Mtb isolates. Mutations in the NusG-RNAP interface reduce pro-pausing activity and increase fitness of RifR Mtb. Collectively, these results define excessive RNAP pausing as a molecular mechanism that drives the fitness cost of RifR in Mtb, identify a new mechanism of compensation to overcome this cost, suggest rational approaches to exacerbate the fitness cost, and, more broadly, could inform new therapeutic approaches to develop drug combinations to slow the evolution of RifR in Mtb.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07206-5
Nature,2024-Apr,Cryo-EM structures of RAD51 assembled on nucleosomes containing a DSB site.,"RAD51 is the central eukaryotic recombinase required for meiotic recombination and mitotic repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs)<sup>1,2</sup>. However, the mechanism by which RAD51 functions at DSB sites in chromatin has remained elusive. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human RAD51-nucleosome complexes, in which RAD51 forms ring and filament conformations. In the ring forms, the N-terminal lobe domains (NLDs) of RAD51 protomers are aligned on the outside of the RAD51 ring, and directly bind to the nucleosomal DNA. The nucleosomal linker DNA that contains the DSB site is recognized by the L1 and L2 loops-active centres that face the central hole of the RAD51 ring. In the filament form, the nucleosomal DNA is peeled by the RAD51 filament extension, and the NLDs of RAD51 protomers proximal to the nucleosome bind to the remaining nucleosomal DNA and histones. Mutations that affect nucleosome-binding residues of the RAD51 NLD decrease nucleosome binding, but barely affect DNA binding in vitro. Consistently, yeast Rad51 mutants with the corresponding mutations are substantially defective in DNA repair in vivo. These results reveal an unexpected function of the RAD51 NLD, and explain the mechanism by which RAD51 associates with nucleosomes, recognizes DSBs and forms the active filament in chromatin.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07196-4
Nature,2024-Apr,A host-microbiota interactome reveals extensive transkingdom connectivity.,"The myriad microorganisms that live in close association with humans have diverse effects on physiology, yet the molecular bases for these impacts remain mostly unknown<sup>1-3</sup>. Classical pathogens often invade host tissues and modulate immune responses through interactions with human extracellular and secreted proteins (the 'exoproteome'). Commensal microorganisms may also facilitate niche colonization and shape host biology by engaging host exoproteins; however, direct exoproteome-microbiota interactions remain largely unexplored. Here we developed and validated a novel technology, BASEHIT, that enables proteome-scale assessment of human exoproteome-microbiome interactions. Using BASEHIT, we interrogated more than 1.7 million potential interactions between 519 human-associated bacterial strains from diverse phylogenies and tissues of origin and 3,324 human exoproteins. The resulting interactome revealed an extensive network of transkingdom connectivity consisting of thousands of previously undescribed host-microorganism interactions involving 383 strains and 651 host proteins. Specific binding patterns within this network implied underlying biological logic; for example, conspecific strains exhibited shared exoprotein-binding patterns, and individual tissue isolates uniquely bound tissue-specific exoproteins. Furthermore, we observed dozens of unique and often strain-specific interactions with potential roles in niche colonization, tissue remodelling and immunomodulation, and found that strains with differing host interaction profiles had divergent interactions with host cells in vitro and effects on the host immune system in vivo. Overall, these studies expose a previously unexplored landscape of molecular-level host-microbiota interactions that may underlie causal effects of indigenous microorganisms on human health and disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07162-0
Nature,2024-Apr,A distinct Fusobacterium nucleatum clade dominates the colorectal cancer niche.,"Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a bacterium present in the human oral cavity and rarely found in the lower gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals<sup>1</sup>, is enriched in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tumours<sup>2-5</sup>. High intratumoural Fn loads are associated with recurrence, metastases and poorer patient prognosis<sup>5-8</sup>. Here, to delineate Fn genetic factors facilitating tumour colonization, we generated closed genomes for 135 Fn strains; 80 oral strains from individuals without cancer and 55 unique cancer strains cultured from tumours from 51 patients with CRC. Pangenomic analyses identified 483 CRC-enriched genetic factors. Tumour-isolated strains predominantly belong to Fn subspecies animalis (Fna). However, genomic analyses reveal that Fna, considered a single subspecies, is instead composed of two distinct clades (Fna C1 and Fna C2). Of these, only Fna C2 dominates the CRC tumour niche. Inter-Fna analyses identified 195 Fna C2-associated genetic factors consistent with increased metabolic potential and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. In support of this, Fna C2-treated mice had an increased number of intestinal adenomas and altered metabolites. Microbiome analysis of human tumour tissue from 116 patients with CRC demonstrated Fna C2 enrichment. Comparison of 62 paired specimens showed that only Fna C2 is tumour enriched compared to normal adjacent tissue. This was further supported by metagenomic analysis of stool samples from 627 patients with CRC and 619 healthy individuals. Collectively, our results identify the Fna clade bifurcation, show that specifically Fna C2 drives the reported Fn enrichment in human CRC and reveal the genetic underpinnings of pathoadaptation of Fna C2 to the CRC niche.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07182-w
Nature,2024-Apr,APOE4/4 is linked to damaging lipid droplets in Alzheimer's disease microglia.,"Several genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease implicate genes involved in lipid metabolism and many of these lipid genes are highly expressed in glial cells<sup>1</sup>. However, the relationship between lipid metabolism in glia and Alzheimer's disease pathology remains poorly understood. Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of brain tissue in Alzheimer's disease, we have identified a microglial state defined by the expression of the lipid droplet-associated enzyme ACSL1 with ACSL1-positive microglia being most abundant in patients with Alzheimer's disease having the APOE4/4 genotype. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, fibrillar Aβ induces ACSL1 expression, triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet accumulation in an APOE-dependent manner. Additionally, conditioned media from lipid droplet-containing microglia lead to Tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in an APOE-dependent manner. Our findings suggest a link between genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease with microglial lipid droplet accumulation and neurotoxic microglia-derived factors, potentially providing therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07185-7
Nature,2024-Apr,Couple-close construction of polycyclic rings from diradicals.,"Heteroarenes are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules, conferring favourable physical properties when compared to their arene counterparts<sup>1-3</sup>. In particular, semisaturated heteroarenes possess attractive solubility properties and a higher fraction of sp<sup>3</sup> carbons, which can improve binding affinity and specificity. However, these desirable structures remain rare owing to limitations in current synthetic methods<sup>4-6</sup>. Indeed, semisaturated heterocycles are laboriously prepared by means of non-modular fit-for-purpose syntheses, which decrease throughput, limit chemical diversity and preclude their inclusion in many hit-to-lead campaigns<sup>7-10</sup>. Herein, we describe a more intuitive and modular couple-close approach to build semisaturated ring systems from dual radical precursors. This platform merges metallaphotoredox C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-C(sp<sup>3</sup>) cross-coupling with intramolecular Minisci-type radical cyclization to fuse abundant heteroaryl halides with simple bifunctional feedstocks, which serve as the diradical synthons, to rapidly assemble a variety of spirocyclic, bridged and substituted saturated ring types that would be extremely difficult to make by conventional methods. The broad availability of the requisite feedstock materials allows sampling of regions of underexplored chemical space. Reagent-controlled radical generation leads to a highly regioselective and stereospecific annulation that can be used for the late-stage functionalization of pharmaceutical scaffolds, replacing lengthy de novo syntheses.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07181-x
Nature,2024-Apr,Neural and behavioural state switching during hippocampal dentate spikes.,"Distinct brain and behavioural states are associated with organized neural population dynamics that are thought to serve specific cognitive functions<sup>1-3</sup>. Memory replay events, for example, occur during synchronous population events called sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus while mice are in an 'offline' behavioural state, enabling cognitive mechanisms such as memory consolidation and planning<sup>4-11</sup>. But how does the brain re-engage with the external world during this behavioural state and permit access to current sensory information or promote new memory formation? Here we found that the hippocampal dentate spike, an understudied population event that frequently occurs between sharp-wave ripples<sup>12</sup>, may underlie such a mechanism. We show that dentate spikes are associated with distinctly elevated brain-wide firing rates, primarily observed in higher order networks, and couple to brief periods of arousal. Hippocampal place coding during dentate spikes aligns to the mouse's current spatial location, unlike the memory replay accompanying sharp-wave ripples. Furthermore, inhibiting neural activity during dentate spikes disrupts associative memory formation. Thus, dentate spikes represent a distinct brain state and support memory during non-locomotor behaviour, extending the repertoire of cognitive processes beyond the classical offline functions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07192-8
Nature,2024-Apr,Neural signatures of natural behaviour in socializing macaques.,"Our understanding of the neurobiology of primate behaviour largely derives from artificial tasks in highly controlled laboratory settings, overlooking most natural behaviours that primate brains evolved to produce<sup>1-3</sup>. How primates navigate the multidimensional social relationships that structure daily life<sup>4</sup> and shape survival and reproductive success<sup>5</sup> remains largely unclear at the single-neuron level. Here we combine ethological analysis, computer vision and wireless recording technologies to identify neural signatures of natural behaviour in unrestrained, socially interacting pairs of rhesus macaques. Single-neuron and population activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortex robustly encoded 24 species-typical behaviours, as well as social context. Male-female partners demonstrated near-perfect reciprocity in grooming, a key behavioural mechanism supporting friendships and alliances<sup>6</sup>, and neural activity maintained a running account of these social investments. Confronted with an aggressive intruder, behavioural and neural population responses reflected empathy and were buffered by the presence of a partner. Our findings reveal a highly distributed neurophysiological ledger of social dynamics, a potential computational foundation supporting communal life in primate societies, including our own.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07178-6
Nature,2024-Apr,Dopamine receptor D2 confers colonization resistance via microbial metabolites.,"The gut microbiome has major roles in modulating host physiology. One such function is colonization resistance, or the ability of the microbial collective to protect the host against enteric pathogens<sup>1-3</sup>, including enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7, an attaching and effacing (AE) food-borne pathogen that causes severe gastroenteritis, enterocolitis, bloody diarrhea and acute renal failure<sup>4,5</sup> (haemolytic uremic syndrome). Although gut microorganisms can provide colonization resistance by outcompeting some pathogens or modulating host defence provided by the gut barrier and intestinal immune cells<sup>6,7</sup>, this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Here, we show that activation of the neurotransmitter receptor dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in the intestinal epithelium by gut microbial metabolites produced upon dietary supplementation with the essential amino acid L-tryptophan protects the host against Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse AE pathogen that is widely used as a model for EHEC infection<sup>8,9</sup>. We further find that DRD2 activation by these tryptophan-derived metabolites decreases expression of a host actin regulatory protein involved in C. rodentium and EHEC attachment to the gut epithelium via formation of actin pedestals. Our results reveal a noncanonical colonization resistance pathway against AE pathogens that features an unconventional role for DRD2 outside the nervous system in controlling actin cytoskeletal organization in the gut epithelium. Our findings may inspire prophylactic and therapeutic approaches targeting DRD2 with dietary or pharmacological interventions to improve gut health and treat gastrointestinal infections, which afflict millions globally.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07179-5
Nature,2024-Apr,Rapid unleashing of macrophage efferocytic capacity via transcriptional pause release.,"During development, inflammation or tissue injury, macrophages may successively engulf and process multiple apoptotic corpses via efferocytosis to achieve tissue homeostasis<sup>1</sup>. How macrophages may rapidly adapt their transcription to achieve continuous corpse uptake is incompletely understood. Transcriptional pause/release is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, in which RNA polymerase (Pol) II initiates transcription for 20-60 nucleotides, is paused for minutes to hours and is then released to make full-length mRNA<sup>2</sup>. Here we show that macrophages, within minutes of corpse encounter, use transcriptional pause/release to unleash a rapid transcriptional response. For human and mouse macrophages, the Pol II pause/release was required for continuous efferocytosis in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, blocking Pol II pause/release did not impede Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, yeast uptake or bacterial phagocytosis. Integration of data from three genomic approaches-precision nuclear run-on sequencing, RNA sequencing, and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)-on efferocytic macrophages at different time points revealed that Pol II pause/release controls expression of select transcription factors and downstream target genes. Mechanistic studies on transcription factor EGR3, prominently regulated by pause/release, uncovered EGR3-related reprogramming of other macrophage genes involved in cytoskeleton and corpse processing. Using lysosomal probes and a new genetic fluorescent reporter, we identify a role for pause/release in phagosome acidification during efferocytosis. Furthermore, microglia from egr3-deficient zebrafish embryos displayed reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and fewer maturing phagosomes, supporting defective corpse processing. Collectively, these data indicate that macrophages use Pol II pause/release as a mechanism to rapidly alter their transcriptional programs for efficient processing of the ingested apoptotic corpses and for successive efferocytosis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07172-y
Nature,2024-Apr,AIRE relies on Z-DNA to flag gene targets for thymic T cell tolerization.,"AIRE is an unconventional transcription factor that enhances the expression of thousands of genes in medullary thymic epithelial cells and promotes clonal deletion or phenotypic diversion of self-reactive T cells<sup>1-4</sup>. The biological logic of AIRE's target specificity remains largely unclear as, in contrast to many transcription factors, it does not bind to a particular DNA sequence motif. Here we implemented two orthogonal approaches to investigate AIRE's cis-regulatory mechanisms: construction of a convolutional neural network and leveraging natural genetic variation through analysis of F1 hybrid mice<sup>5</sup>. Both approaches nominated Z-DNA and NFE2-MAF as putative positive influences on AIRE's target choices. Genome-wide mapping studies revealed that Z-DNA-forming and NFE2L2-binding motifs were positively associated with the inherent ability of a gene's promoter to generate DNA double-stranded breaks, and promoters showing strong double-stranded break generation were more likely to enter a poised state with accessible chromatin and already-assembled transcriptional machinery. Consequently, AIRE preferentially targets genes with poised promoters. We propose a model in which Z-DNA anchors the AIRE-mediated transcriptional program by enhancing double-stranded break generation and promoter poising. Beyond resolving a long-standing mechanistic conundrum, these findings suggest routes for manipulating T cell tolerance.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07169-7
Nature,2024-Apr,Mitochondrial complex I activity in microglia sustains neuroinflammation.,"Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis<sup>1</sup>. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells<sup>2</sup>. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system<sup>3</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07167-9
Nature,2024-Apr,Collective sensing in electric fish.,"A number of organisms, including dolphins, bats and electric fish, possess sophisticated active sensory systems that use self-generated signals (for example, acoustic or electrical emissions) to probe the environment<sup>1,2</sup>. Studies of active sensing in social groups have typically focused on strategies for minimizing interference from conspecific emissions<sup>2-4</sup>. However, it is well known from engineering that multiple spatially distributed emitters and receivers can greatly enhance environmental sensing (for example, multistatic radar and sonar)<sup>5-8</sup>. Here we provide evidence from modelling, neural recordings and behavioural experiments that the African weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii utilizes the electrical pulses of conspecifics to extend its electrolocation range, discriminate objects and increase information transmission. These results provide evidence for a new, collective mode of active sensing in which individual perception is enhanced by the energy emissions of nearby group members.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07157-x
Nature,2024-Apr,Selfish conflict underlies RNA-mediated parent-of-origin effects.,"Genomic imprinting-the non-equivalence of maternal and paternal genomes-is a critical process that has evolved independently in many plant and mammalian species<sup>1,2</sup>. According to kinship theory, imprinting is the inevitable consequence of conflictive selective forces acting on differentially expressed parental alleles<sup>3,4</sup>. Yet, how these epigenetic differences evolve in the first place is poorly understood<sup>3,5,6</sup>. Here we report the identification and molecular dissection of a parent-of-origin effect on gene expression that might help to clarify this fundamental question. Toxin-antidote elements (TAs) are selfish elements that spread in populations by poisoning non-carrier individuals<sup>7-9</sup>. In reciprocal crosses between two Caenorhabditis tropicalis wild isolates, we found that the slow-1/grow-1 TA is specifically inactive when paternally inherited. This parent-of-origin effect stems from transcriptional repression of the slow-1 toxin by the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) host defence pathway. The repression requires PIWI Argonaute and SET-32 histone methyltransferase activities and is transgenerationally inherited via small RNAs. Remarkably, when slow-1/grow-1 is maternally inherited, slow-1 repression is halted by a translation-independent role of its maternal mRNA. That is, slow-1 transcripts loaded into eggs-but not SLOW-1 protein-are necessary and sufficient to counteract piRNA-mediated repression. Our findings show that parent-of-origin effects can evolve by co-option of the piRNA pathway and hinder the spread of selfish genes that require sex for their propagation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07155-z
Nature,2024-Apr,Genome-wide characterization of circulating metabolic biomarkers.,"Genome-wide association analyses using high-throughput metabolomics platforms have led to novel insights into the biology of human metabolism<sup>1-7</sup>. This detailed knowledge of the genetic determinants of systemic metabolism has been pivotal for uncovering how genetic pathways influence biological mechanisms and complex diseases<sup>8-11</sup>. Here we present a genome-wide association study for 233 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in up to 136,016 participants from 33 cohorts. We identify more than 400 independent loci and assign probable causal genes at two-thirds of these using manual curation of plausible biological candidates. We highlight the importance of sample and participant characteristics that can have significant effects on genetic associations. We use detailed metabolic profiling of lipoprotein- and lipid-associated variants to better characterize how known lipid loci and novel loci affect lipoprotein metabolism at a granular level. We demonstrate the translational utility of comprehensively phenotyped molecular data, characterizing the metabolic associations of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Finally, we observe substantial genetic pleiotropy for multiple metabolic pathways and illustrate the importance of careful instrument selection in Mendelian randomization analysis, revealing a putative causal relationship between acetone and hypertension. Our publicly available results provide a foundational resource for the community to examine the role of metabolism across diverse diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07148-y
Nature,2024-Apr,Synthetic reversed sequences reveal default genomic states.,"Pervasive transcriptional activity is observed across diverse species. The genomes of extant organisms have undergone billions of years of evolution, making it unclear whether these genomic activities represent effects of selection or 'noise'<sup>1-4</sup>. Characterizing default genome states could help understand whether pervasive transcriptional activity has biological meaning. Here we addressed this question by introducing a synthetic 101-kb locus into the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus and characterizing genomic activity. The locus was designed by reversing but not complementing human HPRT1, including its flanking regions, thus retaining basic features of the natural sequence but ablating evolved coding or regulatory information. We observed widespread activity of both reversed and native HPRT1 loci in yeast, despite the lack of evolved yeast promoters. By contrast, the reversed locus displayed no activity at all in mouse embryonic stem cells, and instead exhibited repressive chromatin signatures. The repressive signature was alleviated in a locus variant lacking CpG dinucleotides; nevertheless, this variant was also transcriptionally inactive. These results show that synthetic genomic sequences that lack coding information are active in yeast, but inactive in mouse embryonic stem cells, consistent with a major difference in 'default genomic states' between these two divergent eukaryotic cell types, with implications for understanding pervasive transcription, horizontal transfer of genetic information and the birth of new genes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07128-2
Nature,2024-Apr,Triple-junction solar cells with cyanate in ultrawide-bandgap perovskites.,"Perovskite bandgap tuning without quality loss makes perovskites unique among solar absorbers, offering promising avenues for tandem solar cells<sup>1,2</sup>. However, minimizing the voltage loss when their bandgap is increased to above 1.90 eV for triple-junction tandem use is challenging<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we present a previously unknown pseudohalide, cyanate (OCN<sup>-</sup>), with a comparable effective ionic radius (1.97 Å) to bromide (1.95 Å) as a bromide substitute. Electron microscopy and X-ray scattering confirm OCN incorporation into the perovskite lattice. This contributes to notable lattice distortion, ranging from 90.5° to 96.6°, a uniform iodide-bromide distribution and consistent microstrain. Owing to these effects, OCN-based perovskite exhibits enhanced defect formation energy and substantially decreased non-radiative recombination. We achieved an inverted perovskite (1.93 eV) single-junction device with an open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) of 1.422 V, a V<sub>OC</sub> × FF (fill factor) product exceeding 80% of the Shockley-Queisser limit and stable performance under maximum power point tracking, culminating in a 27.62% efficiency (27.10% certified efficiency) perovskite-perovskite-silicon triple-junction solar cell with 1 cm<sup>2</sup> aperture area.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07226-1
Nature,2024-Apr,Dopant-additive synergism enhances perovskite solar modules.,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties<sup>1,2</sup>. However, the lower efficiency, poor stability and reproducibility issues of large-area PSCs compared with laboratory-scale PSCs are notable drawbacks that hinder their commercialization<sup>3</sup>. Here we report a synergistic dopant-additive combination strategy using methylammonium chloride (MACl) as the dopant and a Lewis-basic ionic-liquid additive, 1,3-bis(cyanomethyl)imidazolium chloride ([Bcmim]Cl). This strategy effectively inhibits the degradation of the perovskite precursor solution (PPS), suppresses the aggregation of MACl and results in phase-homogeneous and stable perovskite films with high crystallinity and fewer defects. This approach enabled the fabrication of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) that achieved a certified efficiency of 23.30% and ultimately stabilized at 22.97% over a 27.22-cm<sup>2</sup> aperture area, marking the highest certified PSM performance. Furthermore, the PSMs showed long-term operational stability, maintaining 94.66% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 h under continuous one-sun illumination at room temperature. The interaction between [Bcmim]Cl and MACl was extensively studied to unravel the mechanism leading to an enhancement of device properties. Our approach holds substantial promise for bridging the benchtop-to-rooftop gap and advancing the production and commercialization of large-area perovskite photovoltaics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07228-z
Nature,2024-Apr,Compartmentalized ocular lymphatic system mediates eye-brain immunity.,"The eye, an anatomical extension of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibits many molecular and cellular parallels to the brain. Emerging research demonstrates that changes in the brain are often reflected in the eye, particularly in the retina<sup>1</sup>. Still, the possibility of an immunological nexus between the posterior eye and the rest of the CNS tissues remains unexplored. Here, studying immune responses to herpes simplex virus in the brain, we observed that intravitreal immunization protects mice against intracranial viral challenge. This protection extended to bacteria and even tumours, allowing therapeutic immune responses against glioblastoma through intravitreal immunization. We further show that the anterior and posterior compartments of the eye have distinct lymphatic drainage systems, with the latter draining to the deep cervical lymph nodes through lymphatic vasculature in the optic nerve sheath. This posterior lymphatic drainage, like that of meningeal lymphatics, could be modulated by the lymphatic stimulator VEGFC. Conversely, we show that inhibition of lymphatic signalling on the optic nerve could overcome a major limitation in gene therapy by diminishing the immune response to adeno-associated virus and ensuring continued efficacy after multiple doses. These results reveal a shared lymphatic circuit able to mount a unified immune response between the posterior eye and the brain, highlighting an understudied immunological feature of the eye and opening up the potential for new therapeutic strategies in ocular and CNS diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07130-8
Nature,2024-Apr,Automated model building and protein identification in cryo-EM maps.,"Interpreting electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) maps with atomic models requires high levels of expertise and labour-intensive manual intervention in three-dimensional computer graphics programs<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we present ModelAngelo, a machine-learning approach for automated atomic model building in cryo-EM maps. By combining information from the cryo-EM map with information from protein sequence and structure in a single graph neural network, ModelAngelo builds atomic models for proteins that are of similar quality to those generated by human experts. For nucleotides, ModelAngelo builds backbones with similar accuracy to those built by humans. By using its predicted amino acid probabilities for each residue in hidden Markov model sequence searches, ModelAngelo outperforms human experts in the identification of proteins with unknown sequences. ModelAngelo will therefore remove bottlenecks and increase objectivity in cryo-EM structure determination.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07215-4
Nature,2024-Apr,A patterned human neural tube model using microfluidic gradients.,"The human nervous system is a highly complex but organized organ. The foundation of its complexity and organization is laid down during regional patterning of the neural tube, the embryonic precursor to the human nervous system. Historically, studies of neural tube patterning have relied on animal models to uncover underlying principles. Recently, models of neurodevelopment based on human pluripotent stem cells, including neural organoids<sup>1-5</sup> and bioengineered neural tube development models<sup>6-10</sup>, have emerged. However, such models fail to recapitulate neural patterning along both rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes in a three-dimensional tubular geometry, a hallmark of neural tube development. Here we report a human pluripotent stem cell-based, microfluidic neural tube-like structure, the development of which recapitulates several crucial aspects of neural patterning in brain and spinal cord regions and along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes. This structure was utilized for studying neuronal lineage development, which revealed pre-patterning of axial identities of neural crest progenitors and functional roles of neuromesodermal progenitors and the caudal gene CDX2 in spinal cord and trunk neural crest development. We further developed dorsal-ventral patterned microfluidic forebrain-like structures with spatially segregated dorsal and ventral regions and layered apicobasal cellular organizations that mimic development of the human forebrain pallium and subpallium, respectively. Together, these microfluidics-based neurodevelopment models provide three-dimensional lumenal tissue architectures with in vivo-like spatiotemporal cell differentiation and organization, which will facilitate the study of human neurodevelopment and disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07204-7
Nature,2024-Apr,Double-side 2D/3D heterojunctions for inverted perovskite solar cells.,"Defects at the top and bottom interfaces of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite photoabsorbers diminish the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells owing to charge recombination, ion migration and electric-field inhomogeneities<sup>1-5</sup>. Here we demonstrate that long alkyl amine ligands can generate near-phase-pure 2D perovskites at the top and bottom 3D perovskite interfaces and effectively resolve these issues. At the rear-contact side, we find that the alkyl amine ligand strengthens the interactions with the substrate through acid-base reactions with the phosphonic acid group from the organic hole-transporting self-assembled monolayer molecule, thus regulating the 2D perovskite formation. With this, inverted perovskite solar cells with double-side 2D/3D heterojunctions achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.6% (certified 25.0%), retaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 1,000 h of 1-sun illumination at 85 °C in air.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07189-3
Nature,2024-Apr,The Radcliffe Wave is oscillating.,"Our Sun lies within 300 parsecs of the 2.7-kiloparsecs-long sinusoidal chain of dense gas clouds known as the Radcliffe Wave<sup>1</sup>. The structure's wave-like shape was discovered using three-dimensional dust mapping, but initial kinematic searches for oscillatory motion were inconclusive<sup>2-7</sup>. Here we present evidence that the Radcliffe Wave is oscillating through the Galactic plane while also drifting radially away from the Galactic Centre. We use measurements of line-of-sight velocity<sup>8</sup> for <sup>12</sup>CO and three-dimensional velocities of young stellar clusters to show that the most massive star-forming regions spatially associated with the Radcliffe Wave (including Orion, Cepheus, North America and Cygnus X) move as though they are part of an oscillating wave driven by the gravitational acceleration of the Galactic potential. By treating the Radcliffe Wave as a coherently oscillating structure, we can derive its motion independently of the local Galactic mass distribution, and directly measure local properties of the Galactic potential as well as the Sun's vertical oscillation period. In addition, the measured drift of the Radcliffe Wave radially outwards from the Galactic Centre suggests that the cluster whose supernovae ultimately created today's expanding Local Bubble<sup>9</sup> may have been born in the Radcliffe Wave.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07127-3
Nature,2024-Apr,A high black-hole-to-host mass ratio in a lensed AGN in the early Universe.,"Early JWST observations have uncovered a population of red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of supermassive black hole growth<sup>1-3</sup>. One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply imaged by the strong lensing cluster Abell 2744 (ref. <sup>4</sup>). Here we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened (A<sub>V</sub> ≃ 3) broad emission line active galactic nucleus at a redshift of z<sub>spec</sub> = 7.0451 ± 0.0005. From the width of Hβ (full width at half-maximum = 2,800 ± 250 km s<sup>-1</sup>), we derive a black hole mass of <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mrow> <msub><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow> <mrow><mi>BH</mi></mrow> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <msubsup><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>+</mo> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </msubsup> <mo>×</mo> <mn>1</mn> <msup><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow> <mrow><mn>7</mn></mrow> </msup> <mspace></mspace> <msub><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow> <mrow><mo>⊙</mo></mrow> </msub> </mrow> </math> . We infer a very high ratio of black-hole-to-galaxy mass of at least 3%, an order of magnitude more than that seen in local galaxies<sup>5</sup> and possibly as high as 100%. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (L<sub>bol</sub> = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10<sup>45</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup>) indicate that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit.

Nature,2024-Apr,A massive galaxy that formed its stars at z ≈ 11.,"The formation of galaxies by gradual hierarchical co-assembly of baryons and cold dark matter halos is a fundamental paradigm underpinning modern astrophysics<sup>1,2</sup> and predicts a strong decline in the number of massive galaxies at early cosmic times<sup>3-5</sup>. Extremely massive quiescent galaxies (stellar masses of more than 10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) have now been observed as early as 1-2 billion years after the Big Bang<sup>6-13</sup>. These galaxies are extremely constraining on theoretical models, as they had formed 300-500 Myr earlier, and only some models can form massive galaxies this early<sup>12,14</sup>. Here we report on the spectroscopic observations with the JWST of a massive quiescent galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at redshift 3.205 ± 0.005. It has eluded deep ground-based spectroscopy<sup>8</sup>, it is significantly redder than is typical and its spectrum reveals features typical of much older stellar populations. Detailed modelling shows that its stellar population formed around 1.5 billion years earlier in time (z ≈ 11) at an epoch when dark matter halos of sufficient hosting mass had not yet assembled in the standard scenario<sup>4,5</sup>. This observation may indicate the presence of undetected populations of early galaxies and the possibility of significant gaps in our understanding of early stellar populations, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07191-9
Nature,2024-Apr,Alkene dialkylation by triple radical sorting.,"The development of bimolecular homolytic substitution (S<sub>H</sub>2) catalysis has expanded cross-coupling chemistries by enabling the selective combination of any primary radical with any secondary or tertiary radical through a radical sorting mechanism<sup>1-8</sup>. Biomimetic<sup>9,10</sup> S<sub>H</sub>2 catalysis can be used to merge common feedstock chemicals-such as alcohols, acids and halides-in various permutations for the construction of a single C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-C(sp<sup>3</sup>) bond. The ability to sort these two distinct radicals across commercially available alkenes in a three-component manner would enable the simultaneous construction of two C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-C(sp<sup>3</sup>) bonds, greatly accelerating access to complex molecules and drug-like chemical space<sup>11</sup>. However, the simultaneous in situ formation of electrophilic and primary nucleophilic radicals in the presence of unactivated alkenes is problematic, typically leading to statistical radical recombination, hydrogen atom transfer, disproportionation and other deleterious pathways<sup>12,13</sup>. Here we report the use of bimolecular homolytic substitution catalysis to sort an electrophilic radical and a nucleophilic radical across an unactivated alkene. This reaction involves the in situ formation of three distinct radical species, which are then differentiated by size and electronics, allowing for regioselective formation of the desired dialkylated products. This work accelerates access to pharmaceutically relevant C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-rich molecules and defines a distinct mechanistic approach for alkene dialkylation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07165-x
Nature,2024-Mar,Optomechanical realization of the bosonic Kitaev chain.,"The fermionic Kitaev chain is a canonical model featuring topological Majorana zero modes<sup>1</sup>. We report the experimental realization of its bosonic analogue<sup>2</sup> in a nano-optomechanical network, in which the parametric interactions induce beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing among the nanomechanical modes, analogous to hopping and p-wave pairing in the fermionic case, respectively. This specific structure gives rise to a set of extraordinary phenomena in the bosonic dynamics and transport. We observe quadrature-dependent chiral amplification, exponential scaling of the gain with system size and strong sensitivity to boundary conditions. All these are linked to the unique non-Hermitian topological nature of the bosonic Kitaev chain. We probe the topological phase transition and uncover a rich dynamical phase diagram by controlling interaction phases and amplitudes. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of an exponentially enhanced response to a small perturbation<sup>3,4</sup>. These results represent the demonstration of a new synthetic phase of matter whose bosonic dynamics do not have fermionic parallels, and we have established a powerful system for studying non-Hermitian topology and its applications for signal manipulation and sensing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07174-w
Nature,2024-Mar,A figure of merit for efficiency roll-off in TADF-based organic LEDs.,"Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are a revolutionary light-emitting display technology that has been successfully commercialized in mobile phones and televisions<sup>1,2</sup>. The injected charges form both singlet and triplet excitons, and for high efficiency it is important to enable triplets as well as singlets to emit light. At present, materials that harvest triplets by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are a very active field of research as an alternative to phosphorescent emitters that usually use heavy metal atoms<sup>3,4</sup>. Although excellent progress has been made, in most TADF OLEDs there is a severe decrease of efficiency as the drive current is increased, known as efficiency roll-off. So far, much of the literature suggests that efficiency roll-off should be reduced by minimizing the energy difference between singlet and triplet excited states (ΔE<sub>ST</sub>) to maximize the rate of conversion of triplets to singlets by means of reverse intersystem crossing (k<sub>RISC</sub>)<sup>5-20</sup>. We analyse the efficiency roll-off in a wide range of TADF OLEDs and find that neither of these parameters fully accounts for the reported efficiency roll-off. By considering the dynamic equilibrium between singlets and triplets in TADF materials, we propose a figure of merit for materials design to reduce efficiency roll-off and discuss its correlation with reported data of TADF OLEDs. Our new figure of merit will guide the design and development of TADF materials that can reduce efficiency roll-off. It will help improve the efficiency of TADF OLEDs at realistic display operating conditions and expand the use of TADF materials to applications that require high brightness, such as lighting, augmented reality and lasing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07149-x
Nature,2024-Mar,High-fidelity spin qubit operation and algorithmic initialization above 1 K.,"The encoding of qubits in semiconductor spin carriers has been recognized as a promising approach to a commercial quantum computer that can be lithographically produced and integrated at scale<sup>1-10</sup>. However, the operation of the large number of qubits required for advantageous quantum applications<sup>11-13</sup> will produce a thermal load exceeding the available cooling power of cryostats at millikelvin temperatures. As the scale-up accelerates, it becomes imperative to establish fault-tolerant operation above 1 K, at which the cooling power is orders of magnitude higher<sup>14-18</sup>. Here we tune up and operate spin qubits in silicon above 1 K, with fidelities in the range required for fault-tolerant operations at these temperatures<sup>19-21</sup>. We design an algorithmic initialization protocol to prepare a pure two-qubit state even when the thermal energy is substantially above the qubit energies and incorporate radiofrequency readout to achieve fidelities up to 99.34% for both readout and initialization. We also demonstrate single-qubit Clifford gate fidelities up to 99.85% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 98.92%. These advances overcome the fundamental limitation that the thermal energy must be well below the qubit energies for the high-fidelity operation to be possible, surmounting a main obstacle in the pathway to scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07160-2
Nature,2024-Mar,Five million years of Antarctic Circumpolar Current strength variability.,"The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) represents the world's largest ocean-current system and affects global ocean circulation, climate and Antarctic ice-sheet stability<sup>1-3</sup>. Today, ACC dynamics are controlled by atmospheric forcing, oceanic density gradients and eddy activity<sup>4</sup>. Whereas palaeoceanographic reconstructions exhibit regional heterogeneity in ACC position and strength over Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles<sup>5-8</sup>, the long-term evolution of the ACC is poorly known. Here we document changes in ACC strength from sediment cores in the Pacific Southern Ocean. We find no linear long-term trend in ACC flow since 5.3 million years ago (Ma), in contrast to global cooling<sup>9</sup> and increasing global ice volume<sup>10</sup>. Instead, we observe a reversal on a million-year timescale, from increasing ACC strength during Pliocene global cooling to a subsequent decrease with further Early Pleistocene cooling. This shift in the ACC regime coincided with a Southern Ocean reconfiguration that altered the sensitivity of the ACC to atmospheric and oceanic forcings<sup>11-13</sup>. We find ACC strength changes to be closely linked to 400,000-year eccentricity cycles, probably originating from modulation of precessional changes in the South Pacific jet stream linked to tropical Pacific temperature variability<sup>14</sup>. A persistent link between weaker ACC flow, equatorward-shifted opal deposition and reduced atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during glacial periods first emerged during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT). The strongest ACC flow occurred during warmer-than-present intervals of the Plio-Pleistocene, providing evidence of potentially increasing ACC flow with future climate warming.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07143-3
Nature,2024-Mar,High-threshold and low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory.,"The accumulation of physical errors<sup>1-3</sup> prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction<sup>4</sup> promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm<sup>5</sup>. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes<sup>6</sup>. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7% for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code<sup>7-10</sup> that for 20 years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1 million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000 physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07107-7
Nature,2024-Mar,Thermonuclear explosions on neutron stars reveal the speed of their jets.,"Relativistic jets are observed from accreting and cataclysmic transients throughout the Universe, and have a profound impact on their surroundings<sup>1,2</sup>. Despite their importance, their launch mechanism is not known. For accreting neutron stars, the speed of their compact jets can reveal whether the jets are powered by magnetic fields anchored in the accretion flow<sup>3</sup> or in the star itself<sup>4,5</sup>, but so far no such measurements exist. These objects can show bright explosions on their surface due to unstable thermonuclear burning of recently accreted material, called type-I X-ray bursts<sup>6</sup>, during which the mass-accretion rate increases<sup>7-9</sup>. Here, we report on bright flares in the jet emission for a few minutes after each X-ray burst, attributed to the increased accretion rate. With these flares, we measure the speed of a neutron star compact jet to be <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>v</mi> <mo>=</mo> <msubsup><mrow><mn>0.38</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>0.08</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>+</mo> <mn>0.11</mn></mrow> </msubsup> <mi>c</mi></mrow> </math> , much slower than those from black holes at similar luminosities. This discovery provides a powerful new tool in which we can determine the role that individual system properties have on the jet speed, revealing the dominant jet launching mechanism.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07133-5
Nature,2024-Mar,Controlling the helicity of light by electrical magnetization switching.,"Controlling the intensity of emitted light and charge current is the basis of transferring and processing information<sup>1</sup>. By contrast, robust information storage and magnetic random-access memories are implemented using the spin of the carrier and the associated magnetization in ferromagnets<sup>2</sup>. The missing link between the respective disciplines of photonics, electronics and spintronics is to modulate the circular polarization of the emitted light, rather than its intensity, by electrically controlled magnetization. Here we demonstrate that this missing link is established at room temperature and zero applied magnetic field in light-emitting diodes<sup>2-7</sup>, through the transfer of angular momentum between photons, electrons and ferromagnets. With spin-orbit torque<sup>8-11</sup>, a charge current generates also a spin current to electrically switch the magnetization. This switching determines the spin orientation of injected carriers into semiconductors, in which the transfer of angular momentum from the electron spin to photon controls the circular polarization of the emitted light<sup>2</sup>. The spin-photon conversion with the nonvolatile control of magnetization opens paths to seamlessly integrate information transfer, processing and storage. Our results provide substantial advances towards electrically controlled ultrafast modulation of circular polarization and spin injection with magnetization dynamics for the next-generation information and communication technology<sup>12</sup>, including space-light data transfer. The same operating principle in scaled-down structures or using two-dimensional materials will enable transformative opportunities for quantum information processing with spin-controlled single-photon sources, as well as for implementing spin-dependent time-resolved spectroscopies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07125-5
Nature,2024-Mar,The complex circumstellar environment of supernova 2023ixf.,"The early evolution of a supernova (SN) can reveal information about the environment and the progenitor star. When a star explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief, hours-long shock-breakout flare<sup>1,2</sup>, followed by a cooling phase of emission. However, for stars exploding within a distribution of dense, optically thick circumstellar material (CSM), the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating<sup>3</sup>. Early serendipitous observations<sup>2,4</sup> that lacked ultraviolet (UV) data were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here we report UV spectra of the nearby SN 2023ixf in the galaxy Messier 101 (M101). Using the UV data as well as a comprehensive set of further multiwavelength observations, we temporally resolve the emergence of the explosion shock from a thick medium heated by the SN emission. We derive a reliable bolometric light curve that indicates that the shock breaks out from a dense layer with a radius substantially larger than typical supergiants.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07116-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Disease-associated astrocyte epigenetic memory promotes CNS pathology.,"Disease-associated astrocyte subsets contribute to the pathology of neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<sup>1-8</sup> (EAE), an experimental model for multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the stability of these astrocyte subsets and their ability to integrate past stimulation events. Here we report the identification of an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that exhibits exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses upon rechallenge. Specifically, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, focused interrogation of cells by nucleic acid detection and sequencing, and cell-specific in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic perturbation studies we established that astrocyte memory is controlled by the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which produces acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) that is used by histone acetyltransferase p300 to control chromatin accessibility. The number of ACLY<sup>+</sup>p300<sup>+</sup> memory astrocytes is increased in acute and chronic EAE models, and their genetic inactivation ameliorated EAE. We also detected the pro-inflammatory memory phenotype in human astrocytes in vitro; single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry studies detected increased numbers of ACLY<sup>+</sup>p300<sup>+</sup> astrocytes in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, these studies define an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that promotes CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. These findings may guide novel therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07187-5
Nature,2024-Mar,Resilient anatomy and local plasticity of naive and stress haematopoiesis.,"The bone marrow adjusts blood cell production to meet physiological demands in response to insults. The spatial organization of normal and stress responses are unknown owing to the lack of methods to visualize most steps of blood production. Here we develop strategies to image multipotent haematopoiesis, erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis in mice. We combine these with imaging of myelopoiesis<sup>1</sup> to define the anatomy of normal and stress haematopoiesis. In the steady state, across the skeleton, single stem cells and multipotent progenitors distribute through the marrow enriched near megakaryocytes. Lineage-committed progenitors are recruited to blood vessels, where they contribute to lineage-specific microanatomical structures composed of progenitors and immature cells, which function as the production sites for each major blood lineage. This overall anatomy is resilient to insults, as it was maintained after haemorrhage, systemic bacterial infection and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment, and during ageing. Production sites enable haematopoietic plasticity as they differentially and selectively modulate their numbers and output in response to insults. We found that stress responses are variable across the skeleton: the tibia and the sternum respond in opposite ways to G-CSF, and the skull does not increase erythropoiesis after haemorrhage. Our studies enable in situ analyses of haematopoiesis, define the anatomy of normal and stress responses, identify discrete microanatomical production sites that confer plasticity to haematopoiesis, and uncover unprecedented heterogeneity of stress responses across the skeleton.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07186-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials.,"From protein motifs<sup>1</sup> to black holes<sup>2</sup>, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields<sup>3</sup>. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators<sup>5-8</sup> subject to a bistable potential<sup>9-14</sup>. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations-so-called non-Hermitian skin waves<sup>5-8,15-22</sup>, which are typically unstable-into robust one-way (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that shows the breaking of 'supersymmetry'<sup>23,24</sup> causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion<sup>25</sup> and could emerge in other settings, for example, quantum mechanics<sup>26,27</sup>, optics<sup>28-30</sup> and soft matter<sup>31</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07097-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Pattern formation by turbulent cascades.,"Fully developed turbulence is a universal and scale-invariant chaotic state characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales at which the cascade is eventually arrested by dissipation<sup>1-6</sup>. Here we show how to harness these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns. Pattern formation entails a process of wavelength selection, which can usually be traced to the linear instability of a homogeneous state<sup>7</sup>. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully nonlinear. It is triggered by the non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades: energy piles up at an intermediate scale, which is neither the system size nor the smallest scales at which energy is usually dissipated. Using a combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns can be set by a non-dissipative transport coefficient called odd viscosity, ubiquitous in chiral fluids ranging from bioactive to quantum systems<sup>8-12</sup>. Odd viscosity, which acts as a scale-dependent Coriolis-like force, leads to a two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales, in contrast with rotating fluids in which a two-dimensionalization occurs at large scales<sup>4</sup>. Apart from odd viscosity fluids, we discuss how cascade-induced patterns can arise in natural systems, including atmospheric flows<sup>13-19</sup>, stellar plasma such as the solar wind<sup>20-22</sup>, or the pulverization and coagulation of objects or droplets in which mass rather than energy cascades<sup>23-25</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07074-z
Nature,2024-Mar,Global prediction of extreme floods in ungauged watersheds.,"Floods are one of the most common natural disasters, with a disproportionate impact in developing countries that often lack dense streamflow gauge networks<sup>1</sup>. Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks<sup>2</sup>, but hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed. Here we show that artificial intelligence-based forecasting achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time that is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (zero-day lead time) from a current state-of-the-art global modelling system (the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). In addition, we achieve accuracies over five-year return period events that are similar to or better than current accuracies over one-year return period events. This means that artificial intelligence can provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in ungauged basins. The model developed here was incorporated into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07145-1
Nature,2024-Mar,All-electrical skyrmionic magnetic tunnel junction.,"Topological whirls or 'textures' of spins such as magnetic skyrmions represent the smallest realizable emergent magnetic entities<sup>1-5</sup>. They hold considerable promise as robust, nanometre-scale, mobile bits for sustainable computing<sup>6-8</sup>. A longstanding roadblock to unleashing their potential is the absence of a device enabling deterministic electrical readout of individual spin textures<sup>9,10</sup>. Here we present the wafer-scale realization of a nanoscale chiral magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) hosting a single, ambient skyrmion. Using a suite of electrical and multimodal imaging techniques, we show that the MTJ nucleates skyrmions of fixed polarity, whose large readout signal-20-70% relative to uniformly magnetized states-corresponds directly to skyrmion size. The MTJ exploits complementary nucleation mechanisms to stabilize distinctly sized skyrmions at zero field, thereby realizing three non-volatile electrical states. Crucially, it can electrically write and delete skyrmions to both uniform states with switching energies 1,000 times lower than the state of the art. Here, the applied voltage emulates a magnetic field and, in contrast to conventional MTJs, it reshapes both the energetics and kinetics of the switching transition, enabling deterministic bidirectional switching. Our stack platform enables large readout and efficient switching, and is compatible with lateral manipulation of skyrmionic bits, providing the much-anticipated backbone for all-electrical skyrmionic device architectures<sup>9,10</sup>. Its wafer-scale realizability provides a springboard to harness chiral spin textures for multibit memory and unconventional computing<sup>8,11</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07131-7
Nature,2024-Mar,At least one in a dozen stars shows evidence of planetary ingestion.,"Stellar chemical compositions can be altered by ingestion of planetary material<sup>1,2</sup> and/or planet formation, which removes refractory material from the protostellar disk<sup>3,4</sup>. These 'planet signatures' appear as correlations between elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature<sup>3,5,6</sup>. Detecting these planet signatures, however, is challenging owing to unknown occurrence rates, small amplitudes and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in stellar ages<sup>7,8</sup>. Therefore, stars born together (that is, co-natal) with identical compositions can facilitate the detection of planet signatures. Although previous spectroscopic studies have been limited to a small number of binary stars<sup>9-13</sup>, the Gaia satellite<sup>14</sup> provides opportunities for detecting stellar chemical signatures of planets among co-moving pairs of stars confirmed to be co-natal<sup>15,16</sup>. Here we report high-precision chemical abundances for a homogeneous sample of ninety-one co-natal pairs of stars with a well defined selection function and identify at least seven instances of planetary ingestion, corresponding to an occurrence rate of eight per cent. An independent Bayesian indicator is deployed, which can effectively disentangle the planet signatures from other factors, such as random abundance variation and atomic diffusion<sup>17</sup>. Our study provides evidence of planet signatures and facilitates a deeper understanding of the star-planet-chemistry connection by providing observational constraints on the mechanisms of planet engulfment, formation and evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07091-y
Nature,2024-Mar,US oil and gas system emissions from nearly one million aerial site measurements.,"As airborne methane surveys of oil and gas systems continue to discover large emissions that are missing from official estimates<sup>1-4</sup>, the true scope of methane emissions from energy production has yet to be quantified. We integrate approximately one million aerial site measurements into regional emissions inventories for six regions in the USA, comprising 52% of onshore oil and 29% of gas production over 15 aerial campaigns. We construct complete emissions distributions for each, employing empirically grounded simulations to estimate small emissions. Total estimated emissions range from 0.75% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65%, 0.84%) of covered natural gas production in a high-productivity, gas-rich region to 9.63% (95% CI 9.04%, 10.39%) in a rapidly expanding, oil-focused region. The six-region weighted average is 2.95% (95% CI 2.79%, 3.14%), or roughly three times the national government inventory estimate<sup>5</sup>. Only 0.05-1.66% of well sites contribute the majority (50-79%) of well site emissions in 11 out of 15 surveys. Ancillary midstream facilities, including pipelines, contribute 18-57% of estimated regional emissions, similarly concentrated in a small number of point sources. Together, the emissions quantified here represent an annual loss of roughly US$1 billion in commercial gas value and a US$9.3 billion annual social cost<sup>6</sup>. Repeated, comprehensive, regional remote-sensing surveys offer a path to detect these low-frequency, high-consequence emissions for rapid mitigation, incorporation into official emissions inventories and a clear-eyed assessment of the most effective emission-finding technologies for a given region.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07117-5
Nature,2024-Mar,"Roll-to-roll, high-resolution 3D printing of shape-specific particles.","Particle fabrication has attracted recent attention owing to its diverse applications in bioengineering<sup>1,2</sup>, drug and vaccine delivery<sup>3-5</sup>, microfluidics<sup>6,7</sup>, granular systems<sup>8,9</sup>, self-assembly<sup>5,10,11</sup>, microelectronics<sup>12,13</sup> and abrasives<sup>14</sup>.

Nature,2024-Mar,High-speed and large-scale intrinsically stretchable integrated circuits.,"Intrinsically stretchable electronics with skin-like mechanical properties have been identified as a promising platform for emerging applications ranging from continuous physiological monitoring to real-time analysis of health conditions, to closed-loop delivery of autonomous medical treatment<sup>1-7</sup>. However, current technologies could only reach electrical performance at amorphous-silicon level (that is, charge-carrier mobility of about 1 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), low integration scale (for example, 54 transistors per circuit) and limited functionalities<sup>8-11</sup>. Here we report high-density, intrinsically stretchable transistors and integrated circuits with high driving ability, high operation speed and large-scale integration. They were enabled by a combination of innovations in materials, fabrication process design, device engineering and circuit design. Our intrinsically stretchable transistors exhibit an average field-effect mobility of more than 20 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> under 100% strain, a device density of 100,000 transistors per cm<sup>2</sup>, including interconnects and a high drive current of around 2 μA μm<sup>-1</sup> at a supply voltage of 5 V. Notably, these achieved parameters are on par with state-of-the-art flexible transistors based on metal-oxide, carbon nanotube and polycrystalline silicon materials on plastic substrates<sup>12-14</sup>. Furthermore, we realize a large-scale integrated circuit with more than 1,000 transistors and a stage-switching frequency greater than 1 MHz, for the first time, to our knowledge, in intrinsically stretchable electronics. Moreover, we demonstrate a high-throughput braille recognition system that surpasses human skin sensing ability, enabled by an active-matrix tactile sensor array with a record-high density of 2,500 units per cm<sup>2</sup>, and a light-emitting diode display with a high refreshing speed of 60 Hz and excellent mechanical robustness.

Nature,2024-Mar,Drought triggers and sustains overnight fires in North America.,"Overnight fires are emerging in North America with previously unknown drivers and implications. This notable phenomenon challenges the traditional understanding of the 'active day, quiet night' model of the diurnal fire cycle<sup>1-3</sup> and current fire management practices<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we demonstrate that drought conditions promote overnight burning, which is a key mechanism fostering large active fires. We examined the hourly diurnal cycle of 23,557 fires and identified 1,095 overnight burning events (OBEs, each defined as a night when a fire burned through the night) in North America during 2017-2020 using geostationary satellite data and terrestrial fire records. A total of 99% of OBEs were associated with large fires (>1,000 ha) and at least one OBE was identified in 20% of these large fires. OBEs were early onset after ignition and OBE frequency was positively correlated with fire size. Although warming is weakening the climatological barrier to night-time fires<sup>6</sup>, we found that the main driver of recent OBEs in large fires was the accumulated fuel dryness and availability (that is, drought conditions), which tended to lead to consecutive OBEs in a single wildfire for several days and even weeks. Critically, we show that daytime drought indicators can predict whether an OBE will occur the following night, which could facilitate early detection and management of night-time fires. We also observed increases in fire weather conditions conducive to OBEs over recent decades, suggesting an accelerated disruption of the diurnal fire cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07028-5
Nature,2024-Mar,Self-enhanced mobility enables vortex pattern formation in living matter.,"Ranging from subcellular organelle biogenesis to embryo development, the formation of self-organized structures is a hallmark of living systems. Whereas the emergence of ordered spatial patterns in biology is often driven by intricate chemical signalling that coordinates cellular behaviour and differentiation<sup>1-4</sup>, purely physical interactions can drive the formation of regular biological patterns such as crystalline vortex arrays in suspensions of spermatozoa<sup>5</sup> and bacteria<sup>6</sup>. Here we discovered a new route to self-organized pattern formation driven by physical interactions, which creates large-scale regular spatial structures with multiscale ordering. Specifically we found that dense bacterial living matter spontaneously developed a lattice of mesoscale, fast-spinning vortices; these vortices each consisted of around 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> motile bacterial cells and were arranged in space at greater than centimetre scale and with apparent hexagonal order, whereas individual cells in the vortices moved in coordinated directions with strong polar and vortical order. Single-cell tracking and numerical simulations suggest that the phenomenon is enabled by self-enhanced mobility in the system-that is, the speed of individual cells increasing with cell-generated collective stresses at a given cell density. Stress-induced mobility enhancement and fluidization is prevalent in dense living matter at various scales of length<sup>7-9</sup>. Our findings demonstrate that self-enhanced mobility offers a simple physical mechanism for pattern formation in living systems and, more generally, in other active matter systems<sup>10</sup> near the boundary of fluid- and solid-like behaviours<sup>11-17</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07114-8
Nature,2024-Mar,Global supply chains amplify economic costs of future extreme heat risk.,"Evidence shows a continuing increase in the frequency and severity of global heatwaves<sup>1,2</sup>, raising concerns about the future impacts of climate change and the associated socioeconomic costs<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we develop a disaster footprint analytical framework by integrating climate, epidemiological and hybrid input-output and computable general equilibrium global trade models to estimate the midcentury socioeconomic impacts of heat stress. We consider health costs related to heat exposure, the value of heat-induced labour productivity loss and indirect losses due to economic disruptions cascading through supply chains. Here we show that the global annual incremental gross domestic product loss increases exponentially from 0.03 ± 0.01 (SSP 245)-0.05 ± 0.03 (SSP 585) percentage points during 2030-2040 to 0.05 ± 0.01-0.15 ± 0.04 percentage points during 2050-2060. By 2060, the expected global economic losses reach a total of 0.6-4.6% with losses attributed to health loss (37-45%), labour productivity loss (18-37%) and indirect loss (12-43%) under different shared socioeconomic pathways. Small- and medium-sized developing countries suffer disproportionately from higher health loss in South-Central Africa (2.1 to 4.0 times above global average) and labour productivity loss in West Africa and Southeast Asia (2.0-3.3 times above global average). The supply-chain disruption effects are much more widespread with strong hit to those manufacturing-heavy countries such as China and the USA, leading to soaring economic losses of 2.7 ± 0.7% and 1.8 ± 0.5%, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07147-z
Nature,2024-Mar,Anoxygenic phototroph of the Chloroflexota uses a type I reaction centre.,"Scientific exploration of phototrophic bacteria over nearly 200 years has revealed large phylogenetic gaps between known phototrophic groups that limit understanding of how phototrophy evolved and diversified<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, through Boreal Shield lake water incubations, we cultivated an anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from a previously unknown order within the Chloroflexota phylum that represents a highly novel transition form in the evolution of photosynthesis. Unlike all other known phototrophs, this bacterium uses a type I reaction centre (RCI) for light energy conversion yet belongs to the same bacterial phylum as organisms that use a type II reaction centre (RCII) for phototrophy. Using physiological, phylogenomic and environmental metatranscriptomic data, we demonstrate active RCI-utilizing metabolism by the strain alongside usage of chlorosomes<sup>3</sup> and bacteriochlorophylls<sup>4</sup> related to those of RCII-utilizing Chloroflexota members. Despite using different reaction centres, our phylogenomic data provide strong evidence that RCI-utilizing and RCII-utilizing Chloroflexia members inherited phototrophy from a most recent common phototrophic ancestor. The Chloroflexota phylum preserves an evolutionary record of the use of contrasting phototrophic modes among genetically related bacteria, giving new context for exploring the diversification of phototrophy on Earth.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07180-y
Nature,2024-Mar,Penning micro-trap for quantum computing.,"Trapped ions in radio-frequency traps are among the leading approaches for realizing quantum computers, because of high-fidelity quantum gates and long coherence times<sup>1-3</sup>.

Here we realize a micro-fabricated Penning ion trap that removes these restrictions by replacing the radio-frequency field with a 3 T magnetic field. We demonstrate full quantum control of an ion in this setting, as well as the ability to transport the ion arbitrarily in the trapping plane above the chip. This unique feature of the Penning micro-trap approach opens up a modification of the quantum charge-coupled device architecture with improved connectivity and flexibility, facilitating the realization of large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum sensing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07111-x

Here we describe extendable linear, curved and angled protein building blocks, as well as inter-block interactions, that conform to specified geometric standards; assemblies designed using these blocks inherit their extendability and regular interaction surfaces, enabling them to be expanded or contracted by varying the number of modules, and reinforced with secondary struts. Using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, we validate nanomaterial designs ranging from simple polygonal and circular oligomers that can be concentrically nested, up to large polyhedral nanocages and unbounded straight 'train track' assemblies with reconfigurable sizes and geometries that can be readily blueprinted. Because of the complexity of protein structures and sequence-structure relationships, it has not previously been possible to build up large protein assemblies by deliberate placement of protein backbones onto a blank three-dimensional canvas; the simplicity and geometric regularity of our design platform now enables construction of protein nanomaterials according to 'back of an envelope' architectural blueprints.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07188-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Substrate-induced condensation activates plant TIR domain proteins.,"Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors with an N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain mediate recognition of strain-specific pathogen effectors, typically via their C-terminal ligand-sensing domains<sup>1</sup>. Effector binding enables TIR-encoded enzymatic activities that are required for TIR-NLR (TNL)-mediated immunity<sup>2,3</sup>. Many truncated TNL proteins lack effector-sensing domains but retain similar enzymatic and immune activities<sup>4,5</sup>. The mechanism underlying the activation of these TIR domain proteins remain unclear. Here we show that binding of the TIR substrates NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP induces phase separation of TIR domain proteins in vitro. A similar condensation occurs with a TIR domain protein expressed via its native promoter in response to pathogen inoculation in planta. The formation of TIR condensates is mediated by conserved self-association interfaces and a predicted intrinsically disordered loop region of TIRs. Mutations that disrupt TIR condensates impair the cell death activity of TIR domain proteins. Our data reveal phase separation as a mechanism for the activation of TIR domain proteins and provide insight into substrate-induced autonomous activation of TIR signalling to confer plant immunity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07183-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Evolutionary trajectories of small cell lung cancer under therapy.,"The evolutionary processes that underlie the marked sensitivity of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to chemotherapy and rapid relapse are unknown<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we determined tumour phylogenies at diagnosis and throughout chemotherapy and immunotherapy by multiregion sequencing of 160 tumours from 65 patients. Treatment-naive SCLC exhibited clonal homogeneity at distinct tumour sites, whereas first-line platinum-based chemotherapy led to a burst in genomic intratumour heterogeneity and spatial clonal diversity. We observed branched evolution and a shift to ancestral clones underlying tumour relapse. Effective radio- or immunotherapy induced a re-expansion of founder clones with acquired genomic damage from first-line chemotherapy. Whereas TP53 and RB1 alterations were exclusively part of the common ancestor, MYC family amplifications were frequently not constituents of the founder clone. At relapse, emerging subclonal mutations affected key genes associated with SCLC biology, and tumours harbouring clonal CREBBP/EP300 alterations underwent genome duplications. Gene-damaging TP53 alterations and co-alterations of TP53 missense mutations with TP73, CREBBP/EP300 or FMN2 were significantly associated with shorter disease relapse following chemotherapy. In summary, we uncover key processes of the genomic evolution of SCLC under therapy, identify the common ancestor as the source of clonal diversity at relapse and show central genomic patterns associated with sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07177-7
Nature,2024-Mar,Spatially organized cellular communities form the developing human heart.,"The heart, which is the first organ to develop, is highly dependent on its form to function<sup>1,2</sup>. However, how diverse cardiac cell types spatially coordinate to create the complex morphological structures that are crucial for heart function remains unclear. Here we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-resolution multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization to resolve the identity of the cardiac cell types that develop the human heart. This approach also provided a spatial mapping of individual cells that enables illumination of their organization into cellular communities that form distinct cardiac structures. We discovered that many of these cardiac cell types further specified into subpopulations exclusive to specific communities, which support their specialization according to the cellular ecosystem and anatomical region. In particular, ventricular cardiomyocyte subpopulations displayed an unexpected complex laminar organization across the ventricular wall and formed, with other cell subpopulations, several cellular communities. Interrogating cell-cell interactions within these communities using in vivo conditional genetic mouse models and in vitro human pluripotent stem cell systems revealed multicellular signalling pathways that orchestrate the spatial organization of cardiac cell subpopulations during ventricular wall morphogenesis. These detailed findings into the cellular social interactions and specialization of cardiac cell types constructing and remodelling the human heart offer new insights into structural heart diseases and the engineering of complex multicellular tissues for human heart repair.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07171-z
Nature,2024-Mar,The evolution of menopause in toothed whales.,"Understanding how and why menopause has evolved is a long-standing challenge across disciplines. Females can typically maximize their reproductive success by reproducing for the whole of their adult life. In humans, however, women cease reproduction several decades before the end of their natural lifespan<sup>1,2</sup>. Although progress has been made in understanding the adaptive value of menopause in humans<sup>3,4</sup>, the generality of these findings remains unclear. Toothed whales are the only mammal taxon in which menopause has evolved several times<sup>5</sup>, providing a unique opportunity to test the theories of how and why menopause evolves in a comparative context. Here, we assemble and analyse a comparative database to test competing evolutionary hypotheses. We find that menopause evolved in toothed whales by females extending their lifespan without increasing their reproductive lifespan, as predicted by the 'live-long' hypotheses. We further show that menopause results in females increasing their opportunity for intergenerational help by increasing their lifespan overlap with their grandoffspring and offspring without increasing their reproductive overlap with their daughters. Our results provide an informative comparison for the evolution of human life history and demonstrate that the same pathway that led to menopause in humans can also explain the evolution of menopause in toothed whales.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07159-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Last-mile delivery increases vaccine uptake in Sierra Leone.,"Less than 30% of people in Africa received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine even 18 months after vaccine development<sup>1</sup>. Here, motivated by the observation that residents of remote, rural areas of Sierra Leone faced severe access difficulties<sup>2</sup>, we conducted an intervention with last-mile delivery of doses and health professionals to the most inaccessible areas, along with community mobilization. A cluster randomized controlled trial in 150 communities showed that this intervention with mobile vaccination teams increased the immunization rate by about 26 percentage points within 48-72 h. Moreover, auxiliary populations visited our community vaccination points, which more than doubled the number of inoculations administered. The additional people vaccinated per intervention site translated to an implementation cost of US $33 per person vaccinated. Transportation to reach remote villages accounted for a large share of total intervention costs. Therefore, bundling multiple maternal and child health interventions in the same visit would further reduce costs per person treated. Current research on vaccine delivery maintains a large focus on individual behavioural issues such as hesitancy. Our study demonstrates that prioritizing mobile services to overcome access difficulties faced by remote populations in developing countries can generate increased returns in terms of uptake of health services<sup>3</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07158-w
Nature,2024-Mar,All-optical frequency division on-chip using a single laser.,"The generation of spectrally pure microwave signals is a critical functionality in fundamental and applied sciences, including metrology and communications. Optical frequency combs enable the powerful technique of optical frequency division (OFD) to produce microwave oscillations of the highest quality<sup>1,2</sup>. Current implementations of OFD require multiple lasers, with space- and energy-consuming optical stabilization and electronic feedback components, resulting in device footprints incompatible with integration into a compact and robust photonic platform<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we demonstrate all-optical OFD on a photonic chip by synchronizing two distinct dynamical states of Kerr microresonators pumped by a single continuous-wave laser. The inherent stability of the terahertz beat frequency between the signal and idler fields of an optical parametric oscillator is transferred to a microwave frequency of a Kerr soliton comb, and synchronization is achieved via a coupling waveguide without the need for electronic locking. OFD factors of N = 34 and 468 are achieved for 227 GHz and 16 GHz soliton combs, respectively. In particular, OFD enables a 46 dB phase-noise reduction for the 16 GHz soliton comb, resulting in the lowest microwave noise observed in an integrated photonics platform. Our work represents a simple, effective approach for performing OFD and provides a pathway towards chip-scale devices that can generate microwave frequencies comparable to the purest tones produced in metrological laboratories.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07136-2
Nature,2024-Mar,Anomalous electrons in a metallic kagome ferromagnet.,"Ordinary metals contain electron liquids within well-defined 'Fermi' surfaces at which the electrons behave as if they were non-interacting. In the absence of transitions to entirely new phases such as insulators or superconductors, interactions between electrons induce scattering that is quadratic in the deviation of the binding energy from the Fermi level. A long-standing puzzle is that certain materials do not fit this 'Fermi liquid' description. A common feature is strong interactions between electrons relative to their kinetic energies. One route to this regime is special lattices to reduce the electron kinetic energies. Twisted bilayer graphene<sup>1-4</sup> is an example, and trihexagonal tiling lattices (triangular 'kagome'), with all corner sites removed on a 2 × 2 superlattice, can also host narrow electron bands<sup>5</sup> for which interaction effects would be enhanced. Here we describe spectroscopy revealing non-Fermi-liquid behaviour for the ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub> (ref. <sup>6</sup>). We discover three C<sub>3</sub>-symmetric electron pockets at the Brillouin zone centre, two of which are expected from density functional theory. The third and most sharply defined band emerges at low temperatures and binding energies by means of fractionalization of one of the other two, most likely on the account of enhanced electron-electron interactions owing to a flat band predicted to lie just above the Fermi level. Our discovery opens the topic of how such many-body physics involving flat bands<sup>7,8</sup> could differ depending on whether they arise from lattice geometry or from strongly localized atomic orbitals<sup>9,10</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07085-w
Nature,2024-Mar,Integrated frequency-modulated optical parametric oscillator.,"Optical frequency combs have revolutionized precision measurement, time-keeping and molecular spectroscopy<sup>1-7</sup>. A substantial effort has developed around 'microcombs': integrating comb-generating technologies into compact photonic platforms<sup>5,7-9</sup>. Current approaches for generating these microcombs involve either the electro-optic<sup>10</sup> or Kerr mechanisms<sup>11</sup>. Despite rapid progress, maintaining high efficiency and wide bandwidth remains challenging. Here we introduce a previously unknown class of microcomb-an integrated device that combines electro-optics and parametric amplification to yield a frequency-modulated optical parametric oscillator (FM-OPO). In contrast to the other solutions, it does not form pulses but maintains operational simplicity and highly efficient pump power use with an output resembling a frequency-modulated laser<sup>12</sup>. We outline the working principles of our device and demonstrate it by fabricating the complete optical system in thin-film lithium niobate. We measure pump-to-comb internal conversion efficiency exceeding 93% (34% out-coupled) over a nearly flat-top spectral distribution spanning about 200 modes (over 1 THz). Compared with an electro-optic comb, the cavity dispersion rather than loss determines the FM-OPO bandwidth, enabling broadband combs with a smaller radio-frequency modulation power. The FM-OPO microcomb offers robust operational dynamics, high efficiency and broad bandwidth, promising compact precision tools for metrology, spectroscopy, telecommunications, sensing and computing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07071-2
Nature,2024-Mar,A rapidly time-varying equatorial jet in Jupiter's deep interior.,"Planetary magnetic fields provide a window into the otherwise largely inaccessible dynamics of a planet's deep interior. In particular, interaction between fluid flow in electrically conducting interior regions and the magnetic field there gives rise to observable secular variation (time dependency) of the externally observed magnetic field. Secular variation of Jupiter's field has recently been revealed<sup>1-3</sup> and been shown to arise, in part, from an axisymmetric, equatorial jet<sup>2</sup>. Whether this jet is time dependent has not previously been addressed, yet it is of critical importance for understanding the dynamics of the planet's interior. If steady, it would probably be a manifestation of deep dynamo convective flow (and jets are anticipated as part of that flow<sup>4-9</sup>) but if time dependent on a timescale much shorter than the convective turnover timescale of several hundred years, it would probably have a different origin. Here we show that the jet has a wavelike fluctuation with a period of roughly 4 years, strongly suggestive of the presence of a torsional oscillation<sup>10</sup> (a cylindrically symmetric oscillating flow about the rotation axis) or a localized Alfvén wave in Jupiter's metallic hydrogen interior. This opens a pathway towards revealing otherwise hidden aspects of the magnetic field within the metallic hydrogen region and hence constraining the dynamo that generates Jupiter's magnetic field.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07046-3
Nature,2024-Mar,Disappearing cities on US coasts.,"The sea level along the US coastlines is projected to rise by 0.25-0.3 m by 2050, increasing the probability of more destructive flooding and inundation in major cities<sup>1-3</sup>. However, these impacts may be exacerbated by coastal subsidence-the sinking of coastal land areas<sup>4</sup>-a factor that is often underrepresented in coastal-management policies and long-term urban planning<sup>2,5</sup>. In this study, we combine high-resolution vertical land motion (that is, raising or lowering of land) and elevation datasets with projections of sea-level rise to quantify the potential inundated areas in 32 major US coastal cities. Here we show that, even when considering the current coastal-defence structures, further land area of between 1,006 and 1,389 km<sup>2</sup> is threatened by relative sea-level rise by 2050, posing a threat to a population of 55,000-273,000 people and 31,000-171,000 properties. Our analysis shows that not accounting for spatially variable land subsidence within the cities may lead to inaccurate projections of expected exposure. These potential consequences show the scale of the adaptation challenge, which is not appreciated in most US coastal cities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07038-3
Nature,2024-Mar,Ultra-compact quasi-true time delay for boosting wireless channel capacity.,"Massive-data connectivity has driven the need for efficient, directed communications through beamforming arrays<sup>1-10</sup>. Delay elements are critical in any beamforming signal chain. However, these elements impose fundamental limits on size, channel capacity, power efficiency and effective isotropic radiated power<sup>11</sup>. Although passive phase shifters do not consume DC power, they suffer from narrow bandwidth, poor phase resolution and low power-handling capacity. They introduce a beam squint, in which different frequency components experience different time delays, blurring signals so that they cannot be resolved. This severely limits the data rate of the wireless link, that is, its channel capacity. Although true time delay (TTD) elements<sup>12</sup> solve this problem and service a broad bandwidth, they comprise wavelength-scale transmission lines, making them prohibitively area-inefficient for modern semiconductor processes. Here we address this long-standing problem by introducing a quasi-true time delay (Q-TTD) that miniaturizes TTD elements and breaks fundamental channel-capacity limits of these wireless links. We demonstrate this mechanism for a microwave device implemented in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Key to shrinking the footprint is a reflective-type phase-shifting structure with 3D variable TTD reflectors within a sub-wavelength footprint. This achieves ultra-broadband phase tuning by using them to vary the length of the waveguide's path to ground. They produce a delay-to-area ratio that yields a substantially higher on-chip channel capacity compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. This component, when integrated in arrays, enables high-resolution imaging and low-squint beamforming for wideband communication, on-chip radar and other applications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07075-y
Nature,2024-Mar,Artificial intelligence and illusions of understanding in scientific research.,"Scientists are enthusiastically imagining ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) tools might improve research. Why are AI tools so attractive and what are the risks of implementing them across the research pipeline? Here we develop a taxonomy of scientists' visions for AI, observing that their appeal comes from promises to improve productivity and objectivity by overcoming human shortcomings. But proposed AI solutions can also exploit our cognitive limitations, making us vulnerable to illusions of understanding in which we believe we understand more about the world than we actually do. Such illusions obscure the scientific community's ability to see the formation of scientific monocultures, in which some types of methods, questions and viewpoints come to dominate alternative approaches, making science less innovative and more vulnerable to errors. The proliferation of AI tools in science risks introducing a phase of scientific enquiry in which we produce more but understand less. By analysing the appeal of these tools, we provide a framework for advancing discussions of responsible knowledge production in the age of AI.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07146-0
Nature,2024-Mar,Photonic chip-based low-noise microwave oscillator.,"Numerous modern technologies are reliant on the low-phase noise and exquisite timing stability of microwave signals. Substantial progress has been made in the field of microwave photonics, whereby low-noise microwave signals are generated by the down-conversion of ultrastable optical references using a frequency comb<sup>1-3</sup>. Such systems, however, are constructed with bulk or fibre optics and are difficult to further reduce in size and power consumption. In this work we address this challenge by leveraging advances in integrated photonics to demonstrate low-noise microwave generation via two-point optical frequency division<sup>4,5</sup>. Narrow-linewidth self-injection-locked integrated lasers<sup>6,7</sup> are stabilized to a miniature Fabry-Pérot cavity<sup>8</sup>, and the frequency gap between the lasers is divided with an efficient dark soliton frequency comb<sup>9</sup>. The stabilized output of the microcomb is photodetected to produce a microwave signal at 20 GHz with phase noise of -96 dBc Hz<sup>-1</sup> at 100 Hz offset frequency that decreases to -135 dBc Hz<sup>-1</sup> at 10 kHz offset-values that are unprecedented for an integrated photonic system. All photonic components can be heterogeneously integrated on a single chip, providing a significant advance for the application of photonics to high-precision navigation, communication and timing systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07058-z
Nature,2024-Mar,Integrated optical frequency division for microwave and mmWave generation.,"The generation of ultra-low-noise microwave and mmWave in miniaturized, chip-based platforms can transform communication, radar and sensing systems<sup>1-3</sup>. Optical frequency division that leverages optical references and optical frequency combs has emerged as a powerful technique to generate microwaves with superior spectral purity than any other approaches<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we demonstrate a miniaturized optical frequency division system that can potentially transfer the approach to a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible integrated photonic platform. Phase stability is provided by a large mode volume, planar-waveguide-based optical reference coil cavity<sup>8,9</sup> and is divided down from optical to mmWave frequency by using soliton microcombs generated in a waveguide-coupled microresonator<sup>10-12</sup>. Besides achieving record-low phase noise for integrated photonic mmWave oscillators, these devices can be heterogeneously integrated with semiconductor lasers, amplifiers and photodiodes, holding the potential of large-volume, low-cost manufacturing for fundamental and mass-market applications<sup>13</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07057-0
Nature,2024-Mar,Buoyant crystals halt the cooling of white dwarf stars.,"White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years<sup>1,2</sup> and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out<sup>3,4</sup>. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable with the age of the universe<sup>5</sup>, signalling the presence of a powerful, yet unknown, energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid-liquid distillation mechanism, owing to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities<sup>6-8</sup>. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants<sup>9,10</sup> and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations<sup>11,12</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07102-y
Nature,2024-Mar,Healable and conductive sulfur iodide for solid-state Li-S batteries.,"Solid-state Li-S batteries (SSLSBs) are made of low-cost and abundant materials free of supply chain concerns. Owing to their high theoretical energy densities, they are highly desirable for electric vehicles<sup>1-3</sup>. However, the development of SSLSBs has been historically plagued by the insulating nature of sulfur<sup>4,5</sup> and the poor interfacial contacts induced by its large volume change during cycling<sup>6,7</sup>, impeding charge transfer among different solid components. Here we report an S<sub>9.3</sub>I molecular crystal with I<sub>2</sub> inserted in the crystalline sulfur structure, which shows a semiconductor-level electrical conductivity (approximately 5.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>) at 25 °C; an 11-order-of-magnitude increase over sulfur itself. Iodine introduces new states into the band gap of sulfur and promotes the formation of reactive polysulfides during electrochemical cycling. Further, the material features a low melting point of around 65 °C, which enables repairing of damaged interfaces due to cycling by periodical remelting of the cathode material. As a result, an Li-S<sub>9.3</sub>I battery demonstrates 400 stable cycles with a specific capacity retention of 87%. The design of this conductive, low-melting-point sulfur iodide material represents a substantial advancement in the chemistry of sulfur materials, and opens the door to the practical realization of SSLSBs.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07101-z
Nature,2024-Mar,The hyphal-specific toxin candidalysin promotes fungal gut commensalism.,"The fungus Candida albicans frequently colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract, from which it can disseminate to cause systemic disease. This polymorphic species can transition between growing as single-celled yeast and as multicellular hyphae to adapt to its environment. The current dogma of C. albicans commensalism is that the yeast form is optimal for gut colonization, whereas hyphal cells are detrimental to colonization but critical for virulence<sup>1-3</sup>. Here, we reveal that this paradigm does not apply to multi-kingdom communities in which a complex interplay between fungal morphology and bacteria dictates C. albicans fitness. Thus, whereas yeast-locked cells outcompete wild-type cells when gut bacteria are absent or depleted by antibiotics, hyphae-competent wild-type cells outcompete yeast-locked cells in hosts with replete bacterial populations. This increased fitness of wild-type cells involves the production of hyphal-specific factors including the toxin candidalysin<sup>4,5</sup>, which promotes the establishment of colonization. At later time points, adaptive immunity is engaged, and intestinal immunoglobulin A preferentially selects against hyphal cells<sup>1,6</sup>. Hyphal morphotypes are thus under both positive and negative selective pressures in the gut. Our study further shows that candidalysin has a direct inhibitory effect on bacterial species, including limiting their metabolic output. We therefore propose that C. albicans has evolved hyphal-specific factors, including candidalysin, to better compete with bacterial species in the intestinal niche.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07142-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Near-ultraviolet photon-counting dual-comb spectroscopy.,"Ultraviolet spectroscopy provides unique insights into the structure of matter with applications ranging from fundamental tests to photochemistry in the Earth's atmosphere and astronomical observations from space telescopes<sup>1-8</sup>. At longer wavelengths, dual-comb spectroscopy, using two interfering laser frequency combs, has become a powerful technique capable of simultaneously providing a broad spectral range and very high resolution<sup>9</sup>. Here we demonstrate a photon-counting approach that can extend the unique advantages of this method into ultraviolet regions where nonlinear frequency conversion tends to be very inefficient. Our spectrometer, based on two frequency combs with slightly different repetition frequencies, provides a wide-span, high-resolution frequency calibration within the accuracy of an atomic clock, and overall consistency of the spectra. We demonstrate a signal-to-noise ratio at the quantum limit and an optimal use of the measurement time, provided by the multiplexed recording of all spectral data on a single photon-counter<sup>10</sup>. Our initial experiments are performed in the near-ultraviolet and in the visible spectral ranges with alkali-atom vapour, with a power per comb line as low as a femtowatt. This crucial step towards precision broadband spectroscopy at short wavelengths paves the way for extreme-ultraviolet dual-comb spectroscopy, and, more generally, opens up a new realm of applications for photon-level diagnostics, as encountered, for example, when driving single atoms or molecules.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07094-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Parental histone transfer caught at the replication fork.,"In eukaryotes, DNA compacts into chromatin through nucleosomes<sup>1,2</sup>. Replication of the eukaryotic genome must be coupled to the transmission of the epigenome encoded in the chromatin<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) replisomes associated with the FACT (facilitates chromatin transactions) complex (comprising Spt16 and Pob3) and an evicted histone hexamer. In these structures, FACT is positioned at the front end of the replisome by engaging with the parental DNA duplex to capture the histones through the middle domain and the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of Spt16. The H2A-H2B dimer chaperoned by the carboxyl-terminal domain of Spt16 is stably tethered to the H3-H4 tetramer, while the vacant H2A-H2B site is occupied by the histone-binding domain of Mcm2. The Mcm2 histone-binding domain wraps around the DNA-binding surface of one H3-H4 dimer and extends across the tetramerization interface of the H3-H4 tetramer to the binding site of Spt16 middle domain before becoming disordered. This arrangement leaves the remaining DNA-binding surface of the other H3-H4 dimer exposed to additional interactions for further processing. The Mcm2 histone-binding domain and its downstream linker region are nested on top of Tof1, relocating the parental histones to the replisome front for transfer to the newly synthesized lagging-strand DNA. Our findings offer crucial structural insights into the mechanism of replication-coupled histone recycling for maintaining epigenetic inheritance.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07152-2
Nature,2024-Mar,East-to-west human dispersal into Europe 1.4 million years ago.,"Stone tools stratified in alluvium and loess at Korolevo, western Ukraine, have been studied by several research groups<sup>1-3</sup> since the discovery of the site in the 1970s. Although Korolevo's importance to the European Palaeolithic is widely acknowledged, age constraints on the lowermost lithic artefacts have yet to be determined conclusively. Here, using two methods of burial dating with cosmogenic nuclides<sup>4,5</sup>, we report ages of 1.42 ± 0.10 million years and 1.42 ± 0.28 million years for the sedimentary unit that contains Mode-1-type lithic artefacts. Korolevo represents, to our knowledge, the earliest securely dated hominin presence in Europe, and bridges the spatial and temporal gap between the Caucasus (around 1.85-1.78 million years ago)<sup>6</sup> and southwestern Europe (around 1.2-1.1 million years ago)<sup>7,8</sup>. Our findings advance the hypothesis that Europe was colonized from the east, and our analysis of habitat suitability<sup>9</sup> suggests that early hominins exploited warm interglacial periods to disperse into higher latitudes and relatively continental sites-such as Korolevo-well before the Middle Pleistocene Transition.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07151-3
Nature,2024-Mar,The structure and physical properties of a packaged bacteriophage particle.,"A string of nucleotides confined within a protein capsid contains all the instructions necessary to make a functional virus particle, a virion. Although the structure of the protein capsid is known for many virus species<sup>1,2</sup>, the three-dimensional organization of viral genomes has mostly eluded experimental probes<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we report all-atom structural models of an HK97 virion<sup>5</sup>, including its entire 39,732 base pair genome, obtained through multiresolution simulations. Mimicking the action of a packaging motor<sup>6</sup>, the genome was gradually loaded into the capsid. The structure of the packaged capsid was then refined through simulations of increasing resolution, which produced a 26 million atom model of the complete virion, including water and ions confined within the capsid. DNA packaging occurs through a loop extrusion mechanism<sup>7</sup> that produces globally different configurations of the packaged genome and gives each viral particle individual traits. Multiple microsecond-long all-atom simulations characterized the effect of the packaged genome on capsid structure, internal pressure, electrostatics and diffusion of water, ions and DNA, and revealed the structural imprints of the capsid onto the genome. Our approach can be generalized to obtain complete all-atom structural models of other virus species, thereby potentially revealing new drug targets at the genome-capsid interface.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07150-4
Nature,2024-Mar,A vagal reflex evoked by airway closure.,"Airway integrity must be continuously maintained throughout life. Sensory neurons guard against airway obstruction and, on a moment-by-moment basis, enact vital reflexes to maintain respiratory function<sup>1,2</sup>. Decreased lung capacity is common and life-threatening across many respiratory diseases, and lung collapse can be acutely evoked by chest wall trauma, pneumothorax or airway compression. Here we characterize a neuronal reflex of the vagus nerve evoked by airway closure that leads to gasping. In vivo vagal ganglion imaging revealed dedicated sensory neurons that detect airway compression but not airway stretch. Vagal neurons expressing PVALB mediate airway closure responses and innervate clusters of lung epithelial cells called neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs). Stimulating NEBs or vagal PVALB neurons evoked gasping in the absence of airway threats, whereas ablating NEBs or vagal PVALB neurons eliminated gasping in response to airway closure. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that NEBs uniformly express the mechanoreceptor PIEZO2, and targeted knockout of Piezo2 in NEBs eliminated responses to airway closure. NEBs were dispensable for the Hering-Breuer inspiratory reflex, which indicated that discrete terminal structures detect airway closure and inflation. Similar to the involvement of Merkel cells in touch sensation<sup>3,4</sup>, NEBs are PIEZO2-expressing epithelial cells and, moreover, are crucial for an aspect of lung mechanosensation. These findings expand our understanding of neuronal diversity in the airways and reveal a dedicated vagal pathway that detects airway closure to help preserve respiratory function.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07144-2

Here we report a redox-based strategy for bioconjugation of tryptophan, the rarest amino acid, using oxaziridine reagents that mimic oxidative cyclization reactions in indole-based alkaloid biosynthetic pathways to achieve highly efficient and specific tryptophan labelling. We establish the broad use of this method, termed tryptophan chemical ligation by cyclization (Trp-CLiC), for selectively appending payloads to tryptophan residues on peptides and proteins with reaction rates that rival traditional click reactions and enabling global profiling of hyper-reactive tryptophan sites across whole proteomes. Notably, these reagents reveal a systematic map of tryptophan residues that participate in cation-π interactions, including functional sites that can regulate protein-mediated phase-separation processes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07140-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Decoding chromatin states by proteomic profiling of nucleosome readers.,"DNA and histone modifications combine into characteristic patterns that demarcate functional regions of the genome<sup>1,2</sup>. While many 'readers' of individual modifications have been described<sup>3-5</sup>, how chromatin states comprising composite modification signatures, histone variants and internucleosomal linker DNA are interpreted is a major open question. Here we use a multidimensional proteomics strategy to systematically examine the interaction of around 2,000 nuclear proteins with over 80 modified dinucleosomes representing promoter, enhancer and heterochromatin states. By deconvoluting complex nucleosome-binding profiles into networks of co-regulated proteins and distinct nucleosomal features driving protein recruitment or exclusion, we show comprehensively how chromatin states are decoded by chromatin readers. We find highly distinctive binding responses to different features, many factors that recognize multiple features, and that nucleosomal modifications and linker DNA operate largely independently in regulating protein binding to chromatin. Our online resource, the Modification Atlas of Regulation by Chromatin States (MARCS), provides in-depth analysis tools to engage with our results and advance the discovery of fundamental principles of genome regulation by chromatin states.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07141-5
Nature,2024-Mar,Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries.,"Animals in the natural world constantly encounter geometrically complex landscapes. Successful navigation requires that they understand geometric features of these landscapes, including boundaries, landmarks, corners and curved areas, all of which collectively define the geometry of the environment<sup>1-12</sup>. Crucial to the reconstruction of the geometric layout of natural environments are concave and convex features, such as corners and protrusions. However, the neural substrates that could underlie the perception of concavity and convexity in the environment remain elusive. Here we show that the dorsal subiculum contains neurons that encode corners across environmental geometries in an allocentric reference frame. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we find that corner cells tune their activity to reflect the geometric properties of corners, including corner angles, wall height and the degree of wall intersection. A separate population of subicular neurons encode convex corners of both larger environments and discrete objects. Both corner cells are non-overlapping with the population of subicular neurons that encode environmental boundaries. Furthermore, corner cells that encode concave or convex corners generalize their activity such that they respond, respectively, to concave or convex curvatures within an environment. Together, our findings suggest that the subiculum contains the geometric information needed to reconstruct the shape and layout of naturalistic spatial environments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07139-z
Nature,2024-Mar,A concerted neuron-astrocyte program declines in ageing and schizophrenia.,"Human brains vary across people and over time; such variation is not yet understood in cellular terms. Here we describe a relationship between people's cortical neurons and cortical astrocytes. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyse the prefrontal cortex of 191 human donors aged 22-97 years, including healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia. Latent-factor analysis of these data revealed that, in people whose cortical neurons more strongly expressed genes encoding synaptic components, cortical astrocytes more strongly expressed distinct genes with synaptic functions and genes for synthesizing cholesterol, an astrocyte-supplied component of synaptic membranes. We call this relationship the synaptic neuron and astrocyte program (SNAP). In schizophrenia and ageing-two conditions that involve declines in cognitive flexibility and plasticity<sup>1,2</sup>-cells divested from SNAP: astrocytes, glutamatergic (excitatory) neurons and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons all showed reduced SNAP expression to corresponding degrees. The distinct astrocytic and neuronal components of SNAP both involved genes in which genetic risk factors for schizophrenia were strongly concentrated. SNAP, which varies quantitatively even among healthy people of similar age, may underlie many aspects of normal human interindividual differences and may be an important point of convergence for multiple kinds of pathophysiology.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07109-5
Nature,2024-Mar,Universal recording of immune cell interactions in vivo.,"Immune cells rely on transient physical interactions with other immune and non-immune populations to regulate their function<sup>1</sup>. To study these 'kiss-and-run' interactions directly in vivo, we previously developed LIPSTIC (labelling immune partnerships by SorTagging intercellular contacts)<sup>2</sup>, an approach that uses enzymatic transfer of a labelled substrate between the molecular partners CD40L and CD40 to label interacting cells. Reliance on this pathway limited the use of LIPSTIC to measuring interactions between CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells and antigen-presenting cells, however. Here we report the development of a universal version of LIPSTIC (uLIPSTIC), which can record physical interactions both among immune cells and between immune and non-immune populations irrespective of the receptors and ligands involved. We show that uLIPSTIC can be used, among other things, to monitor the priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by dendritic cells, reveal the steady-state cellular partners of regulatory T cells and identify germinal centre-resident T follicular helper cells on the basis of their ability to interact cognately with germinal centre B cells. By coupling uLIPSTIC with single-cell transcriptomics, we build a catalogue of the immune populations that physically interact with intestinal epithelial cells at the steady state and profile the evolution of the interactome of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in multiple organs following systemic infection. Thus, uLIPSTIC provides a broadly useful technology for measuring and understanding cell-cell interactions across multiple biological systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07134-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Bumblebees socially learn behaviour too complex to innovate alone.,"Culture refers to behaviours that are socially learned and persist within a population over time. Increasing evidence suggests that animal culture can, like human culture, be cumulative: characterized by sequential innovations that build on previous ones<sup>1</sup>. However, human cumulative culture involves behaviours so complex that they lie beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover during their lifetime<sup>1-3</sup>. To our knowledge, no study has so far demonstrated this phenomenon in an invertebrate. Here we show that bumblebees can learn from trained demonstrator bees to open a novel two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrator bees to perform the unrewarded first step without providing a temporary reward linked to this action, which was removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observer bees learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever being rewarded after the first step. This suggests that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to 're-innovate' through individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure for up to 24 days. This finding challenges a common opinion in the field: that the capacity to socially learn behaviours that cannot be innovated through individual trial and error is unique to humans.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07126-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Latitudinal patterns in stabilizing density dependence of forest communities.,"Numerous studies have shown reduced performance in plants that are surrounded by neighbours of the same species<sup>1,2</sup>, a phenomenon known as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)<sup>3</sup>. A long-held ecological hypothesis posits that CNDD is more pronounced in tropical than in temperate forests<sup>4,5</sup>, which increases community stabilization, species coexistence and the diversity of local tree species<sup>6,7</sup>. Previous analyses supporting such a latitudinal gradient in CNDD<sup>8,9</sup> have suffered from methodological limitations related to the use of static data<sup>10-12</sup>. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of latitudinal CNDD patterns using dynamic mortality data to estimate species-site-specific CNDD across 23 sites. Averaged across species, we found that stabilizing CNDD was present at all except one site, but that average stabilizing CNDD was not stronger toward the tropics. However, in tropical tree communities, rare and intermediate abundant species experienced stronger stabilizing CNDD than did common species. This pattern was absent in temperate forests, which suggests that CNDD influences species abundances more strongly in tropical forests than it does in temperate ones<sup>13</sup>. We also found that interspecific variation in CNDD, which might attenuate its stabilizing effect on species diversity<sup>14,15</sup>, was high but not significantly different across latitudes. Although the consequences of these patterns for latitudinal diversity gradients are difficult to evaluate, we speculate that a more effective regulation of population abundances could translate into greater stabilization of tropical tree communities and thus contribute to the high local diversity of tropical forests.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07118-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Integrated lithium niobate microwave photonic processing engine.,"Integrated microwave photonics (MWP) is an intriguing technology for the generation, transmission and manipulation of microwave signals in chip-scale optical systems<sup>1,2</sup>. In particular, ultrafast processing of analogue signals in the optical domain with high fidelity and low latency could enable a variety of applications such as MWP filters<sup>3-5</sup>, microwave signal processing<sup>6-9</sup> and image recognition<sup>10,11</sup>. An ideal integrated MWP processing platform should have both an efficient and high-speed electro-optic modulation block to faithfully perform microwave-optic conversion at low power and also a low-loss functional photonic network to implement various signal-processing tasks. Moreover, large-scale, low-cost manufacturability is required to monolithically integrate the two building blocks on the same chip. Here we demonstrate such an integrated MWP processing engine based on a 4 inch wafer-scale thin-film lithium niobate platform. It can perform multipurpose tasks with processing bandwidths of up to 67 GHz at complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible voltages. We achieve ultrafast analogue computation, namely temporal integration and differentiation, at sampling rates of up to 256 giga samples per second, and deploy these functions to showcase three proof-of-concept applications: solving ordinary differential equations, generating ultra-wideband signals and detecting edges in images. We further leverage the image edge detector to realize a photonic-assisted image segmentation model that can effectively outline the boundaries of melanoma lesion in medical diagnostic images. Our ultrafast lithium niobate MWP engine could provide compact, low-latency and cost-effective solutions for future wireless communications, high-resolution radar and photonic artificial intelligence.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07078-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Imaging the Meissner effect in hydride superconductors using quantum sensors.,"By directly altering microscopic interactions, pressure provides a powerful tuning knob for the exploration of condensed phases and geophysical phenomena<sup>1</sup>. The megabar regime represents an interesting frontier, in which recent discoveries include high-temperature superconductors, as well as structural and valence phase transitions<sup>2-6</sup>. However, at such high pressures, many conventional measurement techniques fail. Here we demonstrate the ability to perform local magnetometry inside a diamond anvil cell with sub-micron spatial resolution at megabar pressures. Our approach uses a shallow layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted directly within the anvil<sup>7-9</sup>; crucially, we choose a crystal cut compatible with the intrinsic symmetries of the nitrogen-vacancy centre to enable functionality at megabar pressures. We apply our technique to characterize a recently discovered hydride superconductor, CeH<sub>9</sub> (ref. <sup>10</sup>). By performing simultaneous magnetometry and electrical transport measurements, we observe the dual signatures of superconductivity: diamagnetism characteristic of the Meissner effect and a sharp drop of the resistance to near zero. By locally mapping both the diamagnetic response and flux trapping, we directly image the geometry of superconducting regions, showing marked inhomogeneities at the micron scale. Our work brings quantum sensing to the megabar frontier and enables the closed-loop optimization of superhydride materials synthesis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07026-7
Nature,2024-Mar,Ligand-channel-enabled ultrafast Li-ion conduction.,"Li-ion batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicles and aviation demand high energy density, fast charging and a wide operating temperature range, which are virtually impossible because they require electrolytes to simultaneously have high ionic conductivity, low solvation energy and low melting point and form an anion-derived inorganic interphase<sup>1-5</sup>. Here we report guidelines for designing such electrolytes by using small-sized solvents with low solvation energy. The tiny solvent in the secondary solvation sheath pulls out the Li<sup>+</sup> in the primary solvation sheath to form a fast ion-conduction ligand channel to enhance Li<sup>+</sup> transport, while the small-sized solvent with low solvation energy also allows the anion to enter the first Li<sup>+</sup> solvation shell to form an inorganic-rich interphase. The electrolyte-design concept is demonstrated by using fluoroacetonitrile (FAN) solvent. The electrolyte of 1.3 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in FAN exhibits ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 40.3 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> at 25 °C and 11.9 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> even at -70 °C, thus enabling 4.5-V graphite||LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pouch cells (1.2 Ah, 2.85 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>) to achieve high reversibility (0.62 Ah) when the cells are charged and discharged even at -65 °C. The electrolyte with small-sized solvents enables LIBs to simultaneously achieve high energy density, fast charging and a wide operating temperature range, which is unattainable for the current electrolyte design but is highly desired for extreme LIBs. This mechanism is generalizable and can be expanded to other metal-ion battery electrolytes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07045-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Crym-positive striatal astrocytes gate perseverative behaviour.,"Astrocytes are heterogeneous glial cells of the central nervous system<sup>1-3</sup>. However, the physiological relevance of astrocyte diversity for neural circuits and behaviour remains unclear. Here we show that a specific population of astrocytes in the central striatum expresses μ-crystallin (encoded by Crym in mice and CRYM in humans) that is associated with several human diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders<sup>4-7</sup>. In adult mice, reducing the levels of μ-crystallin in striatal astrocytes through CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of Crym resulted in perseverative behaviours, increased fast synaptic excitation in medium spiny neurons and dysfunctional excitatory-inhibitory synaptic balance. Increased perseveration stemmed from the loss of astrocyte-gated control of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals of orbitofrontal cortex-striatum projections. We found that perseveration could be remedied using presynaptic inhibitory chemogenetics<sup>8</sup>, and that this treatment also corrected the synaptic deficits. Together, our findings reveal converging molecular, synaptic, circuit and behavioural mechanisms by which a molecularly defined and allocated population of striatal astrocytes gates perseveration phenotypes that accompany neuropsychiatric disorders<sup>9-12</sup>. Our data show that Crym-positive striatal astrocytes have key biological functions within the central nervous system, and uncover astrocyte-neuron interaction mechanisms that could be targeted in treatments for perseveration.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07138-0
Nature,2024-Mar,CST-polymerase α-primase solves a second telomere end-replication problem.,"Telomerase adds G-rich telomeric repeats to the 3' ends of telomeres<sup>1</sup>, counteracting telomere shortening caused by loss of telomeric 3' overhangs during leading-strand DNA synthesis ('the end-replication problem'<sup>2</sup>). Here we report a second end-replication problem that originates from the incomplete duplication of the C-rich telomeric repeat strand (C-strand) by lagging-strand DNA synthesis. This problem is resolved by fill-in synthesis mediated by polymerase α-primase bound to Ctc1-Stn1-Ten1 (CST-Polα-primase). In vitro, priming for lagging-strand DNA replication does not occur on the 3' overhang and lagging-strand synthesis stops in a zone of approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) more than 26 nt from the end of the template. Consistent with the in vitro data, lagging-end telomeres of cells lacking CST-Polα-primase lost 50-60 nt of telomeric CCCTAA repeats per population doubling. The C-strands of leading-end telomeres shortened by around 100 nt per population doubling, reflecting the generation of 3' overhangs through resection. The measured overall C-strand shortening in the absence of CST-Polα-primase fill-in is consistent with the combined effects of incomplete lagging-strand synthesis and 5' resection at the leading ends. We conclude that canonical DNA replication creates two telomere end-replication problems that require telomerase to maintain the G-rich strand and CST-Polα-primase to maintain the C-strand.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07137-1
Nature,2024-Mar,An atlas of epithelial cell states and plasticity in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Understanding the cellular processes that underlie early lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) development is needed to devise intervention strategies<sup>1</sup>. Here we studied 246,102 single epithelial cells from 16 early-stage LUADs and 47 matched normal lung samples. Epithelial cells comprised diverse normal and cancer cell states, and diversity among cancer cells was strongly linked to LUAD-specific oncogenic drivers. KRAS mutant cancer cells showed distinct transcriptional features, reduced differentiation and low levels of aneuploidy. Non-malignant areas surrounding human LUAD samples were enriched with alveolar intermediate cells that displayed elevated KRT8 expression (termed KRT8<sup>+</sup> alveolar intermediate cells (KACs) here), reduced differentiation, increased plasticity and driver KRAS mutations. Expression profiles of KACs were enriched in lung precancer cells and in LUAD cells and signified poor survival. In mice exposed to tobacco carcinogen, KACs emerged before lung tumours and persisted for months after cessation of carcinogen exposure. Moreover, they acquired Kras mutations and conveyed sensitivity to targeted KRAS inhibition in KAC-enriched organoids derived from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Last, lineage-labelling of AT2 cells or KRT8<sup>+</sup> cells following carcinogen exposure showed that KACs are possible intermediates in AT2-to-tumour cell transformation. This study provides new insights into epithelial cell states at the root of LUAD development, and such states could harbour potential targets for prevention or intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07113-9
Nature,2024-Mar,The CRL5-SPSB3 ubiquitin ligase targets nuclear cGAS for degradation.,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) senses aberrant DNA during infection, cancer and inflammatory disease, and initiates potent innate immune responses through the synthesis of 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)<sup>1-7</sup>. The indiscriminate activity of cGAS towards DNA demands tight regulatory mechanisms that are necessary to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis under normal conditions. Inside the cell nucleus, anchoring to nucleosomes and competition with chromatin architectural proteins jointly prohibit cGAS activation by genomic DNA<sup>8-15</sup>. However, the fate of nuclear cGAS and its role in cell physiology remains unclear. Here we show that the ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) degrades nuclear cGAS in cycling cells. We identify SPSB3 as the cGAS-targeting substrate receptor that associates with the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 5 (CRL5) complex to ligate ubiquitin onto nuclear cGAS. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of nucleosome-bound cGAS in a complex with SPSB3 reveals a highly conserved Asn-Asn (NN) minimal degron motif at the C terminus of cGAS that directs SPSB3 recruitment, ubiquitylation and cGAS protein stability. Interference with SPSB3-regulated nuclear cGAS degradation primes cells for type I interferon signalling, conferring heightened protection against infection by DNA viruses. Our research defines protein degradation as a determinant of cGAS regulation in the nucleus and provides structural insights into an element of cGAS that is amenable to therapeutic exploitation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07112-w
Nature,2024-Mar,The Dimorphos ejecta plume properties revealed by LICIACube.,"The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) had an impact with Dimorphos (a satellite of the asteroid Didymos) on 26 September 2022<sup>1</sup>. Ground-based observations showed that the Didymos system brightened by a factor of 8.3 after the impact because of ejecta, returning to the pre-impact brightness 23.7 days afterwards<sup>2</sup>. Hubble Space Telescope observations made from 15 minutes after impact to 18.5 days after, with a spatial resolution of 2.1 kilometres per pixel, showed a complex evolution of the ejecta<sup>3</sup>, consistent with other asteroid impact events. The momentum enhancement factor, determined using the measured binary period change<sup>4</sup>, ranges between 2.2 and 4.9, depending on the assumptions about the mass and density of Dimorphos<sup>5</sup>. Here we report observations from the LUKE and LEIA instruments on the LICIACube cube satellite, which was deployed 15 days in advance of the impact of DART. Data were taken from 71 seconds before the impact until 320 seconds afterwards. The ejecta plume was a cone with an aperture angle of 140 ± 4 degrees. The inner region of the plume was blue, becoming redder with increasing distance from Dimorphos. The ejecta plume exhibited a complex and inhomogeneous structure, characterized by filaments, dust grains and single or clustered boulders. The ejecta velocities ranged from a few tens of metres per second to about 500 metres per second.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06998-2
Nature,2024-Mar,Anti-TIGIT antibody improves PD-L1 blockade through myeloid and T<sub>reg</sub> cells.,"Tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT antibody with an active IgG1κ Fc, demonstrated improved outcomes in the phase 2 CITYSCAPE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03563716 ) when combined with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) versus atezolizumab alone<sup>1</sup>. However, there remains little consensus on the mechanism(s) of response with this combination<sup>2</sup>. Here we find that a high baseline of intratumoural macrophages and regulatory T cells is associated with better outcomes in patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab but not with atezolizumab alone. Serum sample analysis revealed that macrophage activation is associated with a clinical benefit in patients who received the combination treatment. In mouse tumour models, tiragolumab surrogate antibodies inflamed tumour-associated macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells through Fcγ receptors (FcγR), in turn driving anti-tumour CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from an exhausted effector-like state to a more memory-like state. These results reveal a mechanism of action through which TIGIT checkpoint inhibitors can remodel immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments, and suggest that FcγR engagement is an important consideration in anti-TIGIT antibody development.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07121-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Mechanisms of calcium homeostasis orchestrate plant growth and immunity.,"Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is an essential nutrient for plants and a cellular signal, but excessive levels can be toxic and inhibit growth<sup>1,2</sup>. To thrive in dynamic environments, plants must monitor and maintain cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by regulating numerous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters<sup>3</sup>. Here we report two signalling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana that converge on the activation of vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers (CAXs) to scavenge excess cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in plants. One mechanism, activated in response to an elevated external Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, entails calcineurin B-like (CBL) Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), which activate CAXs by phosphorylating a serine (S) cluster in the auto-inhibitory domain. The second pathway, triggered by molecular patterns associated with microorganisms, engages the immune receptor complex FLS2-BAK1 and the associated cytoplasmic kinases BIK1 and PBL1, which phosphorylate the same S-cluster in CAXs to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in immunity. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (CBL-CIPK) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent (FLS2-BAK1-BIK1/PBL1) mechanisms combine to balance plant growth and immunity by regulating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07100-0
Nature,2024-Mar,Neuronal dynamics direct cerebrospinal fluid perfusion and brain clearance.,"The accumulation of metabolic waste is a leading cause of numerous neurological disorders, yet we still have only limited knowledge of how the brain performs self-cleansing. Here we demonstrate that neural networks synchronize individual action potentials to create large-amplitude, rhythmic and self-perpetuating ionic waves in the interstitial fluid of the brain. These waves are a plausible mechanism to explain the correlated potentiation of the glymphatic flow<sup>1,2</sup> through the brain parenchyma. Chemogenetic flattening of these high-energy ionic waves largely impeded cerebrospinal fluid infiltration into and clearance of molecules from the brain parenchyma. Notably, synthesized waves generated through transcranial optogenetic stimulation substantially potentiated cerebrospinal fluid-to-interstitial fluid perfusion. Our study demonstrates that neurons serve as master organizers for brain clearance. This fundamental principle introduces a new theoretical framework for the functioning of macroscopic brain waves.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07108-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Multisensory gamma stimulation promotes glymphatic clearance of amyloid.,"The glymphatic movement of fluid through the brain removes metabolic waste<sup>1-4</sup>. Noninvasive 40 Hz stimulation promotes 40 Hz neural activity in multiple brain regions and attenuates pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease<sup>5-8</sup>. Here we show that multisensory gamma stimulation promotes the influx of cerebrospinal fluid and the efflux of interstitial fluid in the cortex of the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Influx of cerebrospinal fluid was associated with increased aquaporin-4 polarization along astrocytic endfeet and dilated meningeal lymphatic vessels. Inhibiting glymphatic clearance abolished the removal of amyloid by multisensory 40 Hz stimulation. Using chemogenetic manipulation and a genetically encoded sensor for neuropeptide signalling, we found that vasoactive intestinal peptide interneurons facilitate glymphatic clearance by regulating arterial pulsatility. Our findings establish novel mechanisms that recruit the glymphatic system to remove brain amyloid.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07132-6
Nature,2024-Mar,SOX17 enables immune evasion of early colorectal adenomas and cancers.,"A hallmark of cancer is the avoidance of immune destruction. This process has been primarily investigated in locally advanced or metastatic cancer<sup>1-3</sup>; however, much less is known about how pre-malignant or early invasive tumours evade immune detection. Here, to understand this process in early colorectal cancers (CRCs), we investigated how naive colon cancer organoids that were engineered in vitro to harbour Apc-null, Kras<sup>G12D</sup> and Trp53-null (AKP) mutations adapted to the in vivo native colonic environment. Comprehensive transcriptomic and chromatin analyses revealed that the endoderm-specifying transcription factor SOX17 became strongly upregulated in vivo. Notably, whereas SOX17 loss did not affect AKP organoid propagation in vitro, its loss markedly reduced the ability of AKP tumours to persist in vivo. The small fraction of SOX17-null tumours that grew displayed notable interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing effector-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltrates in contrast to the immune-suppressive microenvironment in wild-type counterparts. Mechanistically, in both endogenous Apc-null pre-malignant adenomas and transplanted organoid-derived AKP CRCs, SOX17 suppresses the ability of tumour cells to sense and respond to IFNγ, preventing anti-tumour T cell responses. Finally, SOX17 engages a fetal intestinal programme that drives differentiation away from LGR5<sup>+</sup> tumour cells to produce immune-evasive LGR5<sup>-</sup> tumour cells with lower expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I). We propose that SOX17 is a transcription factor that is engaged during the early steps of colon cancer to orchestrate an immune-evasive programme that permits CRC initiation and progression.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07135-3
Nature,2024-Mar,Incomplete transcripts dominate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis transcriptome.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease that is responsible for major health and economic costs worldwide<sup>1</sup>. Mtb encounters diverse environments during its life cycle and responds to these changes largely by reprogramming its transcriptional output<sup>2</sup>. However, the mechanisms of Mtb transcription and how they are regulated remain poorly understood. Here we use a sequencing method that simultaneously determines both termini of individual RNA molecules in bacterial cells<sup>3</sup> to profile the Mtb transcriptome at high resolution. Unexpectedly, we find that most Mtb transcripts are incomplete, with their 5' ends aligned at transcription start sites and 3' ends located 200-500 nucleotides downstream. We show that these short RNAs are mainly associated with paused RNA polymerases (RNAPs) rather than being products of premature termination. We further show that the high propensity of Mtb RNAP to pause early in transcription relies on the binding of the σ-factor. Finally, we show that a translating ribosome promotes transcription elongation, revealing a potential role for transcription-translation coupling in controlling Mtb gene expression. In sum, our findings depict a mycobacterial transcriptome that prominently features incomplete transcripts resulting from RNAP pausing. We propose that the pausing phase constitutes an important transcriptional checkpoint in Mtb that allows the bacterium to adapt to environmental changes and could be exploited for TB therapeutics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07105-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Mutualisms weaken the latitudinal diversity gradient among oceanic islands.,"The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) dominates global patterns of diversity<sup>1,2</sup>, but the factors that underlie the LDG remain elusive. Here we use a unique global dataset<sup>3</sup> to show that vascular plants on oceanic islands exhibit a weakened LDG and explore potential mechanisms for this effect. Our results show that traditional physical drivers of island biogeography<sup>4</sup>-namely area and isolation-contribute to the difference between island and mainland diversity at a given latitude (that is, the island species deficit), as smaller and more distant islands experience reduced colonization. However, plant species with mutualists are underrepresented on islands, and we find that this plant mutualism filter explains more variation in the island species deficit than abiotic factors. In particular, plant species that require animal pollinators or microbial mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute disproportionately to the island species deficit near the Equator, with contributions decreasing with distance from the Equator. Plant mutualist filters on species richness are particularly strong at low absolute latitudes where mainland richness is highest, weakening the LDG of oceanic islands. These results provide empirical evidence that mutualisms, habitat heterogeneity and dispersal are key to the maintenance of high tropical plant diversity and mediate the biogeographic patterns of plant diversity on Earth.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07110-y
Nature,2024-Mar,Durable and efficient gene silencing in vivo by hit-and-run epigenome editing.,"Permanent epigenetic silencing using programmable editors equipped with transcriptional repressors holds great promise for the treatment of human diseases<sup>1-3</sup>. However, to unlock its full therapeutic potential, an experimental confirmation of durable epigenetic silencing after the delivery of transient delivery of editors in vivo is needed. To this end, here we targeted Pcsk9, a gene expressed in hepatocytes that is involved in cholesterol homeostasis. In vitro screening of different editor designs indicated that zinc-finger proteins were the best-performing DNA-binding platform for efficient silencing of mouse Pcsk9. A single administration of lipid nanoparticles loaded with the editors' mRNAs almost halved the circulating levels of PCSK9 for nearly one year in mice. Notably, Pcsk9 silencing and accompanying epigenetic repressive marks also persisted after forced liver regeneration, further corroborating the heritability of the newly installed epigenetic state. Improvements in construct design resulted in the development of an all-in-one configuration that we term evolved engineered transcriptional repressor (EvoETR). This design, which is characterized by a high specificity profile, further reduced the circulating levels of PCSK9 in mice with an efficiency comparable with that obtained through conventional gene editing, but without causing DNA breaks. Our study lays the foundation for the development of in vivo therapeutics that are based on epigenetic silencing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07087-8
Nature,2024-Mar,Mechanisms of action and resistance in histone methylation-targeted therapy.,"Epigenomes enable the rectification of disordered cancer gene expression, thereby providing new targets for pharmacological interventions. The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated<sup>1-7</sup>. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1-EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2-compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations, TET2 mutation or elevated DNMT3A expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07103-x
Nature,2024-Mar,IL-10 constrains sphingolipid metabolism to limit inflammation.,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine that can limit immune cell activation and cytokine production in innate immune cell types<sup>1</sup>. Loss of IL-10 signalling results in life-threatening inflammatory bowel disease in humans and mice-however, the exact mechanism by which IL-10 signalling subdues inflammation remains unclear<sup>2-5</sup>. Here we find that increased saturated very long chain (VLC) ceramides are critical for the heightened inflammatory gene expression that is a hallmark of IL-10 deficiency. Accordingly, genetic deletion of ceramide synthase 2 (encoded by Cers2), the enzyme responsible for VLC ceramide production, limited the exacerbated inflammatory gene expression programme associated with IL-10 deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. The accumulation of saturated VLC ceramides was regulated by a decrease in metabolic flux through the de novo mono-unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathway. Restoring mono-unsaturated fatty acid availability to cells deficient in IL-10 signalling limited saturated VLC ceramide production and the associated inflammation. Mechanistically, we find that persistent inflammation mediated by VLC ceramides is largely dependent on sustained activity of REL, an immuno-modulatory transcription factor. Together, these data indicate that an IL-10-driven fatty acid desaturation programme rewires VLC ceramide accumulation and aberrant activation of REL. These studies support the idea that fatty acid homeostasis in innate immune cells serves as a key regulatory node to control pathologic inflammation and suggests that 'metabolic correction' of VLC homeostasis could be an important strategy to normalize dysregulated inflammation caused by the absence of IL-10.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07098-5
Nature,2024-Mar,The UFM1 E3 ligase recognizes and releases 60S ribosomes from ER translocons.,"Stalled ribosomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are covalently modified with the ubiquitin-like protein UFM1 on the 60S ribosomal subunit protein RPL26 (also known as uL24)<sup>1,2</sup>. This modification, which is known as UFMylation, is orchestrated by the UFM1 ribosome E3 ligase (UREL) complex, comprising UFL1, UFBP1 and CDK5RAP3 (ref. <sup>3</sup>). However, the catalytic mechanism of UREL and the functional consequences of UFMylation are unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of UREL bound to 60S ribosomes, revealing the basis of its substrate specificity. UREL wraps around the 60S subunit to form a C-shaped clamp architecture that blocks the tRNA-binding sites at one end, and the peptide exit tunnel at the other. A UFL1 loop inserts into and remodels the peptidyl transferase centre. These features of UREL suggest a crucial function for UFMylation in the release and recycling of stalled or terminated ribosomes from the ER membrane. In the absence of functional UREL, 60S-SEC61 translocon complexes accumulate at the ER membrane, demonstrating that UFMylation is necessary for releasing SEC61 from 60S subunits. Notably, this release is facilitated by a functional switch of UREL from a 'writer' to a 'reader' module that recognizes its product-UFMylated 60S ribosomes. Collectively, we identify a fundamental role for UREL in dissociating 60S subunits from the SEC61 translocon and the basis for UFMylation in regulating protein homeostasis at the ER.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07093-w
Nature,2024-Mar,Synaptic wiring motifs in posterior parietal cortex support decision-making.,"The posterior parietal cortex exhibits choice-selective activity during perceptual decision-making tasks<sup>1-10</sup>. However, it is not known how this selective activity arises from the underlying synaptic connectivity. Here we combined virtual-reality behaviour, two-photon calcium imaging, high-throughput electron microscopy and circuit modelling to analyse how synaptic connectivity between neurons in the posterior parietal cortex relates to their selective activity. We found that excitatory pyramidal neurons preferentially target inhibitory interneurons with the same selectivity. In turn, inhibitory interneurons preferentially target pyramidal neurons with opposite selectivity, forming an opponent inhibition motif. This motif was present even between neurons with activity peaks in different task epochs. We developed neural-circuit models of the computations performed by these motifs, and found that opponent inhibition between neural populations with opposite selectivity amplifies selective inputs, thereby improving the encoding of trial-type information. The models also predict that opponent inhibition between neurons with activity peaks in different task epochs contributes to creating choice-specific sequential activity. These results provide evidence for how synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits supports a learned decision-making task.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07088-7
Nature,2024-Mar,Targeted protein degradation via intramolecular bivalent glues.,"Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological modality that is based on the induced proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein to promote target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This has been achieved either via proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)-bifunctional compounds composed of two separate moieties that individually bind the target and E3 ligase, or via molecular glues that monovalently bind either the ligase or the target<sup>1-4</sup>. Here, using orthogonal genetic screening, biophysical characterization and structural reconstitution, we investigate the mechanism of action of bifunctional degraders of BRD2 and BRD4, termed intramolecular bivalent glues (IBGs), and find that instead of connecting target and ligase in trans as PROTACs do, they simultaneously engage and connect two adjacent domains of the target protein in cis. This conformational change 'glues' BRD4 to the E3 ligases DCAF11 or DCAF16, leveraging intrinsic target-ligase affinities that do not translate to BRD4 degradation in the absence of compound. Structural insights into the ternary BRD4-IBG1-DCAF16 complex guided the rational design of improved degraders of low picomolar potency. We thus introduce a new modality in targeted protein degradation, which works by bridging protein domains in cis to enhance surface complementarity with E3 ligases for productive ubiquitination and degradation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07089-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Activation of Thoeris antiviral system via SIR2 effector filament assembly.,"To survive bacteriophage (phage) infections, bacteria developed numerous anti-phage defence systems<sup>1-7</sup>. Some of them (for example, type III CRISPR-Cas, CBASS, Pycsar and Thoeris) consist of two modules: a sensor responsible for infection recognition and an effector that stops viral replication by destroying key cellular components<sup>8-12</sup>. In the Thoeris system, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain protein, ThsB, acts as a sensor that synthesizes an isomer of cyclic ADP ribose, 1''-3' glycocyclic ADP ribose (gcADPR), which is bound in the Smf/DprA-LOG (SLOG) domain of the ThsA effector and activates the silent information regulator 2 (SIR2)-domain-mediated hydrolysis of a key cell metabolite, NAD<sup>+</sup> (refs. <sup>12-14</sup>). Although the structure of ThsA has been solved<sup>15</sup>, the ThsA activation mechanism remained incompletely understood. Here we show that 1''-3' gcADPR, synthesized in vitro by the dimeric ThsB' protein, binds to the ThsA SLOG domain, thereby activating ThsA by triggering helical filament assembly of ThsA tetramers. The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of activated ThsA revealed that filament assembly stabilizes the active conformation of the ThsA SIR2 domain, enabling rapid NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that filament formation enables a switch-like response of ThsA to the 1''-3' gcADPR signal.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07092-x
Nature,2024-Mar,UFM1 E3 ligase promotes recycling of 60S ribosomal subunits from the ER.,"Reversible modification of target proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) is widely used by eukaryotic cells to control protein fate and cell behaviour<sup>1</sup>. UFM1 is a UBL that predominantly modifies a single lysine residue on a single ribosomal protein, uL24 (also called RPL26), on ribosomes at the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<sup>2,3</sup>. UFM1 conjugation (UFMylation) facilitates the rescue of 60S ribosomal subunits (60S) that are released after ribosome-associated quality-control-mediated splitting of ribosomes that stall during co-translational translocation of secretory proteins into the ER<sup>3,4</sup>. Neither the molecular mechanism by which the UFMylation machinery achieves such precise target selection nor how this ribosomal modification promotes 60S rescue is known. Here we show that ribosome UFMylation in vivo occurs on free 60S and we present sequential cryo-electron microscopy snapshots of the heterotrimeric UFM1 E3 ligase (E3(UFM1)) engaging its substrate uL24. E3(UFM1) binds the L1 stalk, empty transfer RNA-binding sites and the peptidyl transferase centre through carboxy-terminal domains of UFL1, which results in uL24 modification more than 150 Å away. After catalysing UFM1 transfer, E3(UFM1) remains stably bound to its product, UFMylated 60S, forming a C-shaped clamp that extends all the way around the 60S from the transfer RNA-binding sites to the polypeptide tunnel exit. Our structural and biochemical analyses suggest a role for E3(UFM1) in post-termination release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the ER membrane.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07073-0
Nature,2024-Mar,Room temperature operation of germanium-silicon single-photon avalanche diode.,"The ability to detect single photons has led to the advancement of numerous research fields<sup>1-11</sup>. Although various types of single-photon detector have been developed<sup>12</sup>, because of two main factors-that is, (1) the need for operating at cryogenic temperature<sup>13,14</sup> and (2) the incompatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes<sup>15,16</sup>-so far, to our knowledge, only Si-based single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)<sup>17,18</sup> has gained mainstream success and has been used in consumer electronics. With the growing demand to shift the operation wavelength from near-infrared to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) for better safety and performance<sup>19-21</sup>, an alternative solution is required because Si has negligible optical absorption for wavelengths beyond 1 µm. Here we report a CMOS-compatible, high-performing germanium-silicon SPAD operated at room temperature, featuring a noise-equivalent power improvement over the previous Ge-based SPADs<sup>22-28</sup> by 2-3.5 orders of magnitude. Key parameters such as dark count rate, single-photon detection probability at 1,310 nm, timing jitter, after-pulsing characteristic time and after-pulsing probability are, respectively, measured as 19 kHz µm<sup>-2</sup>, 12%, 188 ps, ~90 ns and <1%, with a low breakdown voltage of 10.26 V and a small excess bias of 0.75 V. Three-dimensional point-cloud images are captured with direct time-of-flight technique as proof of concept. This work paves the way towards using single-photon-sensitive SWIR sensors, imagers and photonic integrated circuits in everyday life.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07076-x
Nature,2024-Mar,Evolutionary novelties underlie sound production in baleen whales.,"Baleen whales (mysticetes) use vocalizations to mediate their complex social and reproductive behaviours in vast, opaque marine environments<sup>1</sup>. Adapting to an obligate aquatic lifestyle demanded fundamental physiological changes to efficiently produce sound, including laryngeal specializations<sup>2-4</sup>. Whereas toothed whales (odontocetes) evolved a nasal vocal organ<sup>5</sup>, mysticetes have been thought to use the larynx for sound production<sup>1,6-8</sup>. However, there has been no direct demonstration that the mysticete larynx can phonate, or if it does, how it produces the great diversity of mysticete sounds<sup>9</sup>. Here we combine experiments on the excised larynx of three mysticete species with detailed anatomy and computational models to show that mysticetes evolved unique laryngeal structures for sound production. These structures allow some of the largest animals that ever lived to efficiently produce frequency-modulated, low-frequency calls. Furthermore, we show that this phonation mechanism is likely to be ancestral to all mysticetes and shares its fundamental physical basis with most terrestrial mammals, including humans<sup>10</sup>, birds<sup>11</sup>, and their closest relatives, odontocetes<sup>5</sup>. However, these laryngeal structures set insurmountable physiological limits to the frequency range and depth of their vocalizations, preventing them from escaping anthropogenic vessel noise<sup>12,13</sup> and communicating at great depths<sup>14</sup>, thereby greatly reducing their active communication range.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07080-1
Nature,2024-Mar,WNT signalling control by KDM5C during development affects cognition.,"Although KDM5C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in X-linked intellectual disability<sup>1</sup>, the exact mechanisms that lead to cognitive impairment remain unknown. Here we use human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and Kdm5c knockout mice to conduct cellular, transcriptomic, chromatin and behavioural studies. KDM5C is identified as a safeguard to ensure that neurodevelopment occurs at an appropriate timescale, the disruption of which leads to intellectual disability. Specifically, there is a developmental window during which KDM5C directly controls WNT output to regulate the timely transition of primary to intermediate progenitor cells and consequently neurogenesis. Treatment with WNT signalling modulators at specific times reveal that only a transient alteration of the canonical WNT signalling pathway is sufficient to rescue the transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes in patient-derived cells and to induce these changes in wild-type cells. Notably, WNT inhibition during this developmental period also rescues behavioural changes of Kdm5c knockout mice. Conversely, a single injection of WNT3A into the brains of wild-type embryonic mice cause anxiety and memory alterations. Our work identifies KDM5C as a crucial sentinel for neurodevelopment and sheds new light on KDM5C mutation-associated intellectual disability. The results also increase our general understanding of memory and anxiety formation, with the identification of WNT functioning in a transient nature to affect long-lasting cognitive function.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07067-y
Nature,2024-Mar,B cells orchestrate tolerance to the neuromyelitis optica autoantigen AQP4.,"Neuromyelitis optica is a paradigmatic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, in which the water-channel protein AQP4 is the target antigen<sup>1</sup>. The immunopathology in neuromyelitis optica is largely driven by autoantibodies to AQP4<sup>2</sup>. However, the T cell response that is required for the generation of these anti-AQP4 antibodies is not well understood. Here we show that B cells endogenously express AQP4 in response to activation with anti-CD40 and IL-21 and are able to present their endogenous AQP4 to T cells with an AQP4-specific T cell receptor (TCR). A population of thymic B cells emulates a CD40-stimulated B cell transcriptome, including AQP4 (in mice and humans), and efficiently purges the thymic TCR repertoire of AQP4-reactive clones. Genetic ablation of Aqp4 in B cells rescues AQP4-specific TCRs despite sufficient expression of AQP4 in medullary thymic epithelial cells, and B-cell-conditional AQP4-deficient mice are fully competent to raise AQP4-specific antibodies in productive germinal-centre responses. Thus, the negative selection of AQP4-specific thymocytes is dependent on the expression and presentation of AQP4 by thymic B cells. As AQP4 is expressed in B cells in a CD40-dependent (but not AIRE-dependent) manner, we propose that thymic B cells might tolerize against a group of germinal-centre-associated antigens, including disease-relevant autoantigens such as AQP4.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07079-8
Nature,2024-Mar,Making cities mental health friendly for adolescents and young adults.,"Urban life shapes the mental health of city dwellers, and although cities provide access to health, education and economic gain, urban environments are often detrimental to mental health<sup>1,2</sup>. Increasing urbanization over the next three decades will be accompanied by a growing population of children and adolescents living in cities<sup>3</sup>. Shaping the aspects of urban life that influence youth mental health could have an enormous impact on adolescent well-being and adult trajectories<sup>4</sup>. We invited a multidisciplinary, global group of researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people to complete sequential surveys to identify and prioritize the characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for young people. Here we show a set of ranked characteristic statements, grouped by personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental domains of intervention. Life skills for personal development, valuing and accepting young people's ideas and choices, providing safe public space for social connection, employment and job security, centring youth input in urban planning and design, and addressing adverse social determinants were priorities by domain. We report the adversities that COVID-19 generated and link relevant actions to these data. Our findings highlight the need for intersectoral, multilevel intervention and for inclusive, equitable, participatory design of cities that support youth mental health.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07005-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Genetic drivers of heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes pathophysiology.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes<sup>1,2</sup> and molecular mechanisms that are often specific to cell type<sup>3,4</sup>. Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores<sup>5</sup> in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07019-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Genomic data in the All of Us Research Program.,"Comprehensively mapping the genetic basis of human disease across diverse individuals is a long-standing goal for the field of human genetics<sup>1-4</sup>. The All of Us Research Program is a longitudinal cohort study aiming to enrol a diverse group of at least one million individuals across the USA to accelerate biomedical research and improve human health<sup>5,6</sup>. Here we describe the programme's genomics data release of 245,388 clinical-grade genome sequences. This resource is unique in its diversity as 77% of participants are from communities that are historically under-represented in biomedical research and 46% are individuals from under-represented racial and ethnic minorities. All of Us identified more than 1 billion genetic variants, including more than 275 million previously unreported genetic variants, more than 3.9 million of which had coding consequences. Leveraging linkage between genomic data and the longitudinal electronic health record, we evaluated 3,724 genetic variants associated with 117 diseases and found high replication rates across both participants of European ancestry and participants of African ancestry. Summary-level data are publicly available, and individual-level data can be accessed by researchers through the All of Us Researcher Workbench using a unique data passport model with a median time from initial researcher registration to data access of 29 hours.

Nature,2024-Mar,Nuclear morphology is shaped by loop-extrusion programs.,"It is well established that neutrophils adopt malleable polymorphonuclear shapes to migrate through narrow interstitial tissue spaces<sup>1-3</sup>. However, how polymorphonuclear structures are assembled remains unknown<sup>4</sup>. Here we show that in neutrophil progenitors, halting loop extrusion-a motor-powered process that generates DNA loops by pulling in chromatin<sup>5</sup>-leads to the assembly of polymorphonuclear genomes. Specifically, we found that in mononuclear neutrophil progenitors, acute depletion of the loop-extrusion loading factor nipped-B-like protein (NIPBL) induced the assembly of horseshoe, banded, ringed and hypersegmented nuclear structures and led to a reduction in nuclear volume, mirroring what is observed during the differentiation of neutrophils. Depletion of NIPBL also induced cell-cycle arrest, activated a neutrophil-specific gene program and conditioned a loss of interactions across topologically associating domains to generate a chromatin architecture that resembled that of differentiated neutrophils. Removing NIPBL resulted in enrichment for mega-loops and interchromosomal hubs that contain genes associated with neutrophil-specific enhancer repertoires and an inflammatory gene program. On the basis of these observations, we propose that in neutrophil progenitors, loop-extrusion programs produce lineage-specific chromatin architectures that permit the packing of chromosomes into geometrically confined lobular structures. Our data also provide a blueprint for the assembly of polymorphonuclear structures, and point to the possibility of engineering de novo nuclear shapes to facilitate the migration of effector cells in densely populated tumorigenic environments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07086-9
Nature,2024-Mar,Visuo-frontal interactions during social learning in freely moving macaques.,"Social interactions represent a ubiquitous aspect of our everyday life that we acquire by interpreting and responding to visual cues from conspecifics<sup>1</sup>. However, despite the general acceptance of this view, how visual information is used to guide the decision to cooperate is unknown. Here, we wirelessly recorded the spiking activity of populations of neurons in the visual and prefrontal cortex in conjunction with wireless recordings of oculomotor events while freely moving macaques engaged in social cooperation. As animals learned to cooperate, visual and executive areas refined the representation of social variables, such as the conspecific or reward, by distributing socially relevant information among neurons in each area. Decoding population activity showed that viewing social cues influences the decision to cooperate. Learning social events increased coordinated spiking between visual and prefrontal cortical neurons, which was associated with improved accuracy of neural populations to encode social cues and the decision to cooperate. These results indicate that the visual-frontal cortical network prioritizes relevant sensory information to facilitate learning social interactions while freely moving macaques interact in a naturalistic environment.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07084-x
Nature,2024-Mar,Rainforest transformation reallocates energy from green to brown food webs.,"Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change<sup>1,2</sup>. However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across 'green' aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and 'brown' belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to -90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion<sup>3</sup>. Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change<sup>4-6</sup> are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07083-y
Nature,2024-Mar,Nuclear export of circular RNA.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are increasingly being implicated in a variety of functions in normal and cancerous cells<sup>1-5</sup>, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus<sup>6-10</sup>. circRNAs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here we identify a pathway that is specific for the nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. Enhancing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient by depletion or chemical inhibition of the major protein exporter CRM1 selectively increases the nuclear export of circRNAs, while reducing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient selectively blocks circRNA export. Depletion or knockout of exportin-2 specifically inhibits nuclear export of circRNA. Analysis of nuclear circRNA-binding proteins reveals that interaction between IGF2BP1 and circRNA is enhanced by Ran-GTP. The formation of circRNA export complexes in the nucleus is promoted by Ran-GTP through its interactions with exportin-2, circRNA and IGF2BP1. Our findings demonstrate that adaptors such as IGF2BP1 that bind directly to circular RNAs recruit Ran-GTP and exportin-2 to export circRNAs in a mechanism that is analogous to protein export, rather than mRNA export.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07060-5
Nature,2024-Mar,Structure of human phagocyte NADPH oxidase in the activated state.,"Phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a protein complex with a core made up of NOX2 and p22 subunits, is responsible for transferring electrons from intracellular NADPH to extracellular oxygen<sup>1</sup>. This process generates superoxide anions that are vital for killing pathogens<sup>1</sup>. The activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase requires membrane translocation and the binding of several cytosolic factors<sup>2</sup>. However, the exact mechanism by which cytosolic factors bind to and activate NOX2 is not well understood. Here we present the structure of the human NOX2-p22 complex activated by fragments of three cytosolic factors: p47, p67 and Rac1. The structure reveals that the p67-Rac1 complex clamps onto the dehydrogenase domain of NOX2 and induces its contraction, which stabilizes the binding of NADPH and results in a reduction of the distance between the NADPH-binding domain and the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain. Furthermore, the dehydrogenase domain docks onto the bottom of the transmembrane domain of NOX2, which reduces the distance between FAD and the inner haem. These structural rearrangements might facilitate the efficient transfer of electrons between the redox centres in NOX2 and lead to the activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07056-1
Nature,2024-Mar,Deep whole-genome analysis of 494 hepatocellular carcinomas.,"Over half of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases diagnosed worldwide are in China<sup>1-3</sup>. However, whole-genome analysis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC in Chinese individuals is limited<sup>4-8</sup>, with current analyses of HCC mainly from non-HBV-enriched populations<sup>9,10</sup>. Here we initiated the Chinese Liver Cancer Atlas (CLCA) project and performed deep whole-genome sequencing (average depth, 120×) of 494 HCC tumours. We identified 6 coding and 28 non-coding previously undescribed driver candidates. Five previously undescribed mutational signatures were found, including aristolochic-acid-associated indel and doublet base signatures, and a single-base-substitution signature that we termed SBS_H8. Pentanucleotide context analysis and experimental validation confirmed that SBS_H8 was distinct to the aristolochic-acid-associated SBS22. Notably, HBV integrations could take the form of extrachromosomal circular DNA, resulting in elevated copy numbers and gene expression. Our high-depth data also enabled us to characterize subclonal clustered alterations, including chromothripsis, chromoplexy and kataegis, suggesting that these catastrophic events could also occur in late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. Pathway analysis of all classes of alterations further linked non-coding mutations to dysregulation of liver metabolism. Finally, we performed in vitro and in vivo assays to show that fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), determined as both a candidate coding and non-coding driver, regulates HCC progression and metastasis. Our CLCA study depicts a detailed genomic landscape and evolutionary history of HCC in Chinese individuals, providing important clinical implications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07054-3
Nature,2024-Mar,Genetic determinants of micronucleus formation in vivo.,"Genomic instability arising from defective responses to DNA damage<sup>1</sup> or mitotic chromosomal imbalances<sup>2</sup> can lead to the sequestration of DNA in aberrant extranuclear structures called micronuclei (MN). Although MN are a hallmark of ageing and diseases associated with genomic instability, the catalogue of genetic players that regulate the generation of MN remains to be determined. Here we analyse 997 mouse mutant lines, revealing 145 genes whose loss significantly increases (n = 71) or decreases (n = 74) MN formation, including many genes whose orthologues are linked to human disease. We found that mice null for Dscc1, which showed the most significant increase in MN, also displayed a range of phenotypes characteristic of patients with cohesinopathy disorders. After validating the DSCC1-associated MN instability phenotype in human cells, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to define synthetic lethal and synthetic rescue interactors. We found that the loss of SIRT1 can rescue phenotypes associated with DSCC1 loss in a manner paralleling restoration of protein acetylation of SMC3.

The basolateral amygdala is a centre of salience networks that underlie emotional experiences and thus has a key role in long-term fear memory formation<sup>1</sup>. Here we used spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate the cellular and molecular architecture of the role of the basolateral amygdala in long-term memory. We identified transcriptional signatures in subpopulations of neurons and astrocytes that were memory-specific and persisted for weeks. These transcriptional signatures implicate neuropeptide and BDNF signalling, MAPK and CREB activation, ubiquitination pathways, and synaptic connectivity as key components of long-term memory. Notably, upon long-term memory formation, a neuronal subpopulation defined by increased Penk and decreased Tac expression constituted the most prominent component of the memory engram of the basolateral amygdala. These transcriptional changes were observed both with single-cell RNA sequencing and with single-molecule spatial transcriptomics in intact slices, thereby providing a rich spatial map of a memory engram. The spatial data enabled us to determine that this neuronal subpopulation interacts with adjacent astrocytes, and functional experiments show that neurons require interactions with astrocytes to encode long-term memory.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07011-6
Nature,2024-Mar,Identification of direct connections between the dura and the brain.,"The arachnoid barrier delineates the border between the central nervous system and dura mater. Although the arachnoid barrier creates a partition, communication between the central nervous system and the dura mater is crucial for waste clearance and immune surveillance<sup>1,2</sup>. How the arachnoid barrier balances separation and communication is poorly understood. Here, using transcriptomic data, we developed transgenic mice to examine specific anatomical structures that function as routes across the arachnoid barrier. Bridging veins create discontinuities where they cross the arachnoid barrier, forming structures that we termed arachnoid cuff exit (ACE) points. The openings that ACE points create allow the exchange of fluids and molecules between the subarachnoid space and the dura, enabling the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and limited entry of molecules from the dura to the subarachnoid space. In healthy human volunteers, magnetic resonance imaging tracers transit along bridging veins in a similar manner to access the subarachnoid space. Notably, in neuroinflammatory conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, ACE points also enable cellular trafficking, representing a route for immune cells to directly enter the subarachnoid space from the dura mater. Collectively, our results indicate that ACE points are a critical part of the anatomy of neuroimmune communication in both mice and humans that link the central nervous system with the dura and its immunological diversity and waste clearance systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06993-7
Nature,2024-Mar,A dynamical measure of the black hole mass in a quasar 11 billion years ago.,"Tight relationships exist in the local Universe between the central stellar properties of galaxies and the mass of their supermassive black hole (SMBH)<sup>1-3</sup>. These suggest that galaxies and black holes co-evolve, with the main regulation mechanism being energetic feedback from accretion onto the black hole during its quasar phase<sup>4-6</sup>. A crucial question is how the relationship between black holes and galaxies evolves with time; a key epoch to examine this relationship is at the peaks of star formation and black hole growth 8-12 billion years ago (redshifts 1-3)<sup>7</sup>. Here we report a dynamical measurement of the mass of the black hole in a luminous quasar at a redshift of 2, with a look back in time of 11 billion years, by spatially resolving the broad-line region (BLR). We detect a 40-μas (0.31-pc) spatial offset between the red and blue photocentres of the Hα line that traces the velocity gradient of a rotating BLR. The flux and differential phase spectra are well reproduced by a thick, moderately inclined disk of gas clouds within the sphere of influence of a central black hole with a mass of 3.2 × 10<sup>8</sup> solar masses. Molecular gas data reveal a dynamical mass for the host galaxy of 6 × 10<sup>11</sup> solar masses, which indicates an undermassive black hole accreting at a super-Eddington rate. This suggests a host galaxy that grew faster than the SMBH, indicating a delay between galaxy and black hole formation for some systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07053-4
Nature,2024-Mar,Redefining the treponemal history through pre-Columbian genomes from Brazil.,"The origins of treponemal diseases have long remained unknown, especially considering the sudden onset of the first syphilis epidemic in the late 15th century in Europe and its hypothesized arrival from the Americas with Columbus' expeditions<sup>1,2</sup>. Recently, ancient DNA evidence has revealed various treponemal infections circulating in early modern Europe and colonial-era Mexico<sup>3-6</sup>. However, there has been to our knowledge no genomic evidence of treponematosis recovered from either the Americas or the Old World that can be reliably dated to the time before the first trans-Atlantic contacts. Here, we present treponemal genomes from nearly 2,000-year-old human remains from Brazil. We reconstruct four ancient genomes of a prehistoric treponemal pathogen, most closely related to the bejel-causing agent Treponema pallidum endemicum. Contradicting the modern day geographical niche of bejel in the arid regions of the world, the results call into question the previous palaeopathological characterization of treponeme subspecies and showcase their adaptive potential. A high-coverage genome is used to improve molecular clock date estimations, placing the divergence of modern T. pallidum subspecies firmly in pre-Columbian times. Overall, our study demonstrates the opportunities within archaeogenetics to uncover key events in pathogen evolution and emergence, paving the way to new hypotheses on the origin and spread of treponematoses.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06965-x
Nature,2024-Mar,The hagfish genome and the evolution of vertebrates.,"As the only surviving lineages of jawless fishes, hagfishes and lampreys provide a crucial window into early vertebrate evolution<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we investigate the complex history, timing and functional role of genome-wide duplications<sup>4-7</sup> and programmed DNA elimination<sup>8,9</sup> in vertebrates in the light of a chromosome-scale genome sequence for the brown hagfish Eptatretus atami. Combining evidence from syntenic and phylogenetic analyses, we establish a comprehensive picture of vertebrate genome evolution, including an auto-tetraploidization (1R<sub>V</sub>) that predates the early Cambrian cyclostome-gnathostome split, followed by a mid-late Cambrian allo-tetraploidization (2R<sub>JV</sub>) in gnathostomes and a prolonged Cambrian-Ordovician hexaploidization (2R<sub>CY</sub>) in cyclostomes. Subsequently, hagfishes underwent extensive genomic changes, with chromosomal fusions accompanied by the loss of genes that are essential for organ systems (for example, genes involved in the development of eyes and in the proliferation of osteoclasts); these changes account, in part, for the simplification of the hagfish body plan<sup>1,2</sup>. Finally, we characterize programmed DNA elimination in hagfish, identifying protein-coding genes and repetitive elements that are deleted from somatic cell lineages during early development. The elimination of these germline-specific genes provides a mechanism for resolving genetic conflict between soma and germline by repressing germline and pluripotency functions, paralleling findings in lampreys<sup>10,11</sup>. Reconstruction of the early genomic history of vertebrates provides a framework for further investigations of the evolution of cyclostomes and jawed vertebrates.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07070-3
Nature,2024-Mar,Deciphering cell states and genealogies of human haematopoiesis.,"The human blood system is maintained through the differentiation and massive amplification of a limited number of long-lived haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)<sup>1</sup>. Perturbations to this process underlie diverse diseases, but the clonal contributions to human haematopoiesis and how this changes with age remain incompletely understood. Although recent insights have emerged from barcoding studies in model systems<sup>2-5</sup>, simultaneous detection of cell states and phylogenies from natural barcodes in humans remains challenging. Here we introduce an improved, single-cell lineage-tracing system based on deep detection of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA mutations with simultaneous readout of transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility. We use this system to define the clonal architecture of HSCs and map the physiological state and output of clones. We uncover functional heterogeneity in HSC clones, which is stable over months and manifests as both differences in total HSC output and biases towards the production of different mature cell types. We also find that the diversity of HSC clones decreases markedly with age, leading to an oligoclonal structure with multiple distinct clonal expansions. Our study thus provides a clonally resolved and cell-state-aware atlas of human haematopoiesis at single-cell resolution, showing an unappreciated functional diversity of human HSC clones and, more broadly, paving the way for refined studies of clonal dynamics across a range of tissues in human health and disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07066-z
Nature,2024-Mar,A small and vigorous black hole in the early Universe.,"Several theories have been proposed to describe the formation of black hole seeds in the early Universe and to explain the emergence of very massive black holes observed in the first thousand million years after the Big Bang<sup>1-3</sup>. Models consider different seeding and accretion scenarios<sup>4-7</sup>, which require the detection and characterization of black holes in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang to be validated. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z = 10.6, revealing the detection of the [NeIV]λ2423 and CII*λ1335 transitions (typical of active galactic nuclei), as well as semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than 10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, typical of the broad line region of active galactic nuclei. These spectral features indicate that GN-z11 hosts an accreting black hole. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIVλ1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with velocity 800-1,000 km s<sup>-1</sup>, probably driven by the active galactic nucleus. Assuming local virial relations, we derive a black hole mass of <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>log</mi> <mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <msub><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow> <mrow><mi>BH</mi></mrow> </msub> <mo>/</mo> <msub><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow> <mrow><mo>⊙</mo></mrow> </msub> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mn>6.2</mn> <mo>±</mo> <mn>0.3</mn></mrow> </math> , accreting at about five times the Eddington rate. These properties are consistent with both heavy seeds scenarios and scenarios considering intermediate and light seeds experiencing episodic super-Eddington phases. Our finding explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07052-5
Nature,2024-Mar,A shock flash breaking out of a dusty red supergiant.,"Shock-breakout emission is light that arises when a shockwave, generated by the core-collapse explosion of a massive star, passes through its outer envelope. Hitherto, the earliest detection of such a signal was at several hours after the explosion<sup>1</sup>, although a few others had been reported<sup>2-7</sup>. The temporal evolution of early light curves should provide insights into the shock propagation, including explosion asymmetry and environment in the vicinity, but this has been hampered by the lack of multiwavelength observations. Here we report the instant multiband observations of a type II supernova (SN 2023ixf) in the galaxy M101 (at a distance of 6.85 ± 0.15 Mpc; ref. <sup>8</sup>), beginning at about 1.4 h after the explosion. The exploding star was a red supergiant with a radius of about 440 solar radii. The light curves evolved rapidly, on timescales of 1-2 h, and appeared unusually fainter and redder than predicted by the models<sup>9-11</sup> within the first few hours, which we attribute to an optically thick dust shell before it was disrupted by the shockwave. We infer that the breakout and perhaps the distribution of the surrounding dust were not spherically symmetric.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06843-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Site-specific reactivity of stepped Pt surfaces driven by stress release.,"Heterogeneous catalysts are widely used to promote chemical reactions. Although it is known that chemical reactions usually happen on catalyst surfaces, only specific surface sites have high catalytic activity. Thus, identifying active sites and maximizing their presence lies at the heart of catalysis research<sup>1-4</sup>, in which the classic model is to categorize active sites in terms of distinct surface motifs, such as terraces and steps<sup>1,5-10</sup>. However, such a simple categorization often leads to orders of magnitude errors in catalyst activity predictions and qualitative uncertainties of active sites<sup>7,8,11,12</sup>, thus limiting opportunities for catalyst design. Here, using stepped Pt(111) surfaces and the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as examples, we demonstrate that the root cause of larger errors and uncertainties is a simplified categorization that overlooks atomic site-specific reactivity driven by surface stress release. Specifically, surface stress release at steps introduces inhomogeneous strain fields, with up to 5.5% compression, leading to distinct electronic structures and reactivity for terrace atoms with identical local coordination, and resulting in atomic site-specific enhancement of ORR activity. For the terrace atoms flanking both sides of the step edge, the enhancement is up to 50 times higher than that of the atoms in the middle of the terrace, which permits control of ORR reactivity by either varying terrace widths or controlling external stress. Thus, the discovery of the above synergy provides a new perspective for both fundamental understanding of catalytically active atomic sites and design principles of heterogeneous catalysts.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07090-z
Nature,2024-Feb,On the genetic basis of tail-loss evolution in humans and apes.,"The loss of the tail is among the most notable anatomical changes to have occurred along the evolutionary lineage leading to humans and to the 'anthropomorphous apes'<sup>1-3</sup>, with a proposed role in contributing to human bipedalism<sup>4-6</sup>. Yet, the genetic mechanism that facilitated tail-loss evolution in hominoids remains unknown. Here we present evidence that an individual insertion of an Alu element in the genome of the hominoid ancestor may have contributed to tail-loss evolution. We demonstrate that this Alu element-inserted into an intron of the TBXT gene<sup>7-9</sup>-pairs with a neighbouring ancestral Alu element encoded in the reverse genomic orientation and leads to a hominoid-specific alternative splicing event. To study the effect of this splicing event, we generated multiple mouse models that express both full-length and exon-skipped isoforms of Tbxt, mimicking the expression pattern of its hominoid orthologue TBXT. Mice expressing both Tbxt isoforms exhibit a complete absence of the tail or a shortened tail depending on the relative abundance of Tbxt isoforms expressed at the embryonic tail bud. These results support the notion that the exon-skipped transcript is sufficient to induce a tail-loss phenotype. Moreover, mice expressing the exon-skipped Tbxt isoform develop neural tube defects, a condition that affects approximately 1 in 1,000 neonates in humans<sup>10</sup>. Thus, tail-loss evolution may have been associated with an adaptive cost of the potential for neural tube defects, which continue to affect human health today.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07095-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Ion and lipid orchestration of secondary active transport.,"Transporting small molecules across cell membranes is an essential process in cell physiology. Many structurally diverse, secondary active transporters harness transmembrane electrochemical gradients of ions to power the uptake or efflux of nutrients, signalling molecules, drugs and other ions across cell membranes. Transporters reside in lipid bilayers on the interface between two aqueous compartments, where they are energized and regulated by symported, antiported and allosteric ions on both sides of the membrane and the membrane bilayer itself. Here we outline the mechanisms by which transporters couple ion and solute fluxes and discuss how structural and mechanistic variations enable them to meet specific physiological needs and adapt to environmental conditions. We then consider how general bilayer properties and specific lipid binding modulate transporter activity. Together, ion gradients and lipid properties ensure the effective transport, regulation and distribution of small molecules across cell membranes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07062-3
Nature,2024-Feb,High fatigue resistance in a titanium alloy via near-void-free 3D printing.,"The advantage of 3D printing-that is, additive manufacturing (AM) of structural materials-has been severely compromised by their disappointing fatigue properties<sup>1,2</sup>. Commonly, poor fatigue properties appear to result from the presence of microvoids induced by current printing process procedures<sup>3,4</sup>. Accordingly, the question that we pose is whether the elimination of such microvoids can provide a feasible solution for marked enhancement of the fatigue resistance of void-free AM (Net-AM) alloys. Here we successfully rebuild an approximate void-free AM microstructure in Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy by development of a Net-AM processing technique through an understanding of the asynchronism of phase transformation and grain growth. We identify the fatigue resistance of such AM microstructures and show that they lead to a high fatigue limit of around 1 GPa, exceeding the fatigue resistance of all AM and forged titanium alloys as well as that of other metallic materials. We confirm the high fatigue resistance of Net-AM microstructures and the potential advantages of AM processing in the production of structural components with maximum fatigue strength, which is beneficial for further application of AM technologies in engineering fields.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07048-1
Nature,2024-Feb,Symmetry breaking and chiral amplification in prebiotic ligation reactions.,"The single chirality of biological molecules is a signature of life. Yet, rationalizing how single chirality emerged remains a challenging goal<sup>1</sup>. Research has commonly focused on initial symmetry breaking and subsequent enantioenrichment of monomer building blocks-sugars and amino acids-that compose the genetic polymers RNA and DNA as well as peptides. If these building blocks are only partially enantioenriched, however, stalling of chain growth may occur, whimsically termed in the case of nucleic acids as ""the problem of original syn""<sup>2</sup>. Here, in studying a new prebiotically plausible route to proteinogenic peptides<sup>3-5</sup>, we discovered that the reaction favours heterochiral ligation (that is, the ligation of L monomers with D monomers). Although this finding seems problematic for the prebiotic emergence of homochiral L-peptides, we demonstrate, paradoxically, that this heterochiral preference provides a mechanism for enantioenrichment in homochiral chains. Symmetry breaking, chiral amplification and chirality transfer processes occur for all reactants and products in multicomponent competitive reactions even when only one of the molecules in the complex mixture exhibits an imbalance in enantiomer concentrations (non-racemic). Solubility considerations rationalize further chemical purification and enhanced chiral amplification. Experimental data and kinetic modelling support this prebiotically plausible mechanism for the emergence of homochiral biological polymers.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07059-y
Nature,2024-Feb,Supramolecular polymers form tactoids through liquid-liquid phase separation.,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers has recently been shown to play a central role in the formation of membraneless organelles with a multitude of biological functions<sup>1-3</sup>. The interplay between LLPS and macromolecular condensation is part of continuing studies<sup>4,5</sup>. Synthetic supramolecular polymers are the non-covalent equivalent of macromolecules but they are not reported to undergo LLPS yet. Here we show that continuously growing fibrils, obtained from supramolecular polymerizations of synthetic components, are responsible for phase separation into highly anisotropic aqueous liquid droplets (tactoids) by means of an entropy-driven pathway. The crowding environment, regulated by dextran concentration, affects not only the kinetics of supramolecular polymerizations but also the properties of LLPS, including phase-separation kinetics, morphology, internal order, fluidity and mechanical properties of the final tactoids. In addition, substrate-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces proved capable of accelerating LLPS of supramolecular polymers, allowing the generation of a myriad of three-dimensional-ordered structures, including highly ordered arrays of micrometre-long tactoids at surfaces. The generality and many possibilities of supramolecular polymerizations to control emerging morphologies are demonstrated with several supramolecular polymers, opening up a new field of matter ranging from highly structured aqueous solutions by means of stabilized LLPS to nanoscopic soft matter.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07034-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Identifying general reaction conditions by bandit optimization.,"Reaction conditions that are generally applicable to a wide variety of substrates are highly desired, especially in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries<sup>1-6</sup>. Although many approaches are available to evaluate the general applicability of developed conditions, a universal approach to efficiently discover these conditions during optimizations is rare. Here we report the design, implementation and application of reinforcement learning bandit optimization models<sup>7-10</sup> to identify generally applicable conditions by efficient condition sampling and evaluation of experimental feedback. Performance benchmarking on existing datasets statistically showed high accuracies for identifying general conditions, with up to 31% improvement over baselines that mimic state-of-the-art optimization approaches. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C-H arylation reaction, an aniline amide coupling reaction and a phenol alkylation reaction were investigated experimentally to evaluate use cases and functionalities of the bandit optimization model in practice. In all three cases, the reaction conditions that were most generally applicable yet not well studied for the respective reaction were identified after surveying less than 15% of the expert-designed reaction space.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07021-y
Nature,2024-Feb,Most of the photons that reionized the Universe came from dwarf galaxies.,"The identification of sources driving cosmic reionization, a major phase transition from neutral hydrogen to ionized plasma around 600-800 Myr after the Big Bang<sup>1-3</sup>, has been a matter of debate<sup>4</sup>. Some models suggest that high ionizing emissivity and escape fractions (f<sub>esc</sub>) from quasars support their role in driving cosmic reionization<sup>5,6</sup>. Others propose that the high f<sub>esc</sub> values from bright galaxies generate sufficient ionizing radiation to drive this process<sup>7</sup>. Finally, a few studies suggest that the number density of faint galaxies, when combined with a stellar-mass-dependent model of ionizing efficiency and f<sub>esc</sub>, can effectively dominate cosmic reionization<sup>8,9</sup>. However, so far, comprehensive spectroscopic studies of low-mass galaxies have not been done because of their extreme faintness. Here we report an analysis of eight ultra-faint galaxies (in a very small field) during the epoch of reionization with absolute magnitudes between M<sub>UV</sub> ≈ -17 mag and -15 mag (down to 0.005L<sup>⋆</sup> (refs. <sup>10,11</sup>)). We find that faint galaxies during the first thousand million years of the Universe produce ionizing photons with log[ξ<sub>ion</sub> (Hz erg<sup>-1</sup>)] = 25.80 ± 0.14, a factor of 4 higher than commonly assumed values<sup>12</sup>. If this field is representative of the large-scale distribution of faint galaxies, the rate of ionizing photons exceeds that needed for reionization, even for escape fractions of the order of 5%.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07043-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Prevalence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 in a large community surveillance study.,"Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections may act as viral reservoirs that could seed future outbreaks<sup>1-5</sup>, give rise to highly divergent lineages<sup>6-8</sup> and contribute to cases with post-acute COVID-19 sequelae (long COVID)<sup>9,10</sup>. However, the population prevalence of persistent infections, their viral load kinetics and evolutionary dynamics over the course of infections remain largely unknown. Here, using viral sequence data collected as part of a national infection survey, we identified 381 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNA at high titre persisting for at least 30 days, of which 54 had viral RNA persisting at least 60 days. We refer to these as 'persistent infections' as available evidence suggests that they represent ongoing viral replication, although the persistence of non-replicating RNA cannot be ruled out in all. Individuals with persistent infection had more than 50% higher odds of self-reporting long COVID than individuals with non-persistent infection. We estimate that 0.1-0.5% of infections may become persistent with typically rebounding high viral loads and last for at least 60 days. In some individuals, we identified many viral amino acid substitutions, indicating periods of strong positive selection, whereas others had no consensus change in the sequences for prolonged periods, consistent with weak selection. Substitutions included mutations that are lineage defining for SARS-CoV-2 variants, at target sites for monoclonal antibodies and/or are commonly found in immunocompromised people<sup>11-14</sup>. This work has profound implications for understanding and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemiology and evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07029-4
Nature,2024-Feb,Monolithic silicon for high spatiotemporal translational photostimulation.,"Electrode-based electrical stimulation underpins several clinical bioelectronic devices, including deep-brain stimulators<sup>1,2</sup> and cardiac pacemakers<sup>3</sup>. However, leadless multisite stimulation is constrained by the technical difficulties and spatial-access limitations of electrode arrays. Optogenetics offers optically controlled random access with high spatiotemporal capabilities, but clinical translation poses challenges<sup>4-6</sup>. Here we show tunable spatiotemporal photostimulation of cardiac systems using a non-genetic platform based on semiconductor-enabled biomodulation interfaces. Through spatiotemporal profiling of photoelectrochemical currents, we assess the magnitude, precision, accuracy and resolution of photostimulation in four leadless silicon-based monolithic photoelectrochemical devices. We demonstrate the optoelectronic capabilities of the devices through optical overdrive pacing of cultured cardiomyocytes (CMs) targeting several regions and spatial extents, isolated rat hearts in a Langendorff apparatus, in vivo rat hearts in an ischaemia model and an in vivo mouse heart model with transthoracic optical pacing. We also perform the first, to our knowledge, optical override pacing and multisite pacing of a pig heart in vivo. Our systems are readily adaptable for minimally invasive clinical procedures using our custom endoscopic delivery device, with which we demonstrate closed-thoracic operations and endoscopic optical stimulation. Our results indicate the clinical potential of the leadless, lightweight and multisite photostimulation platform as a pacemaker in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), in which lead-placement complications are common.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07016-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Super-additive cooperation.,"Repeated interactions provide an evolutionary explanation for one-shot human cooperation that is counterintuitive but orthodox<sup>1-3</sup>. Intergroup competition<sup>4-7</sup> provides an explanation that is intuitive but heterodox. Here, using models and a behavioural experiment, we show that neither mechanism reliably supports cooperation. Ambiguous reciprocity, a class of strategies that is generally ignored in models of reciprocal altruism, undermines cooperation under repeated interactions. This finding challenges repeated interactions as an evolutionary explanation for cooperation in general, which further challenges the claim that repeated interactions in the past can explain one-shot cooperation in the present. Intergroup competitions also do not reliably support cooperation because groups quickly become extremely similar, which limits scope for group selection. Moreover, even if groups vary, group competitions may generate little group selection for multiple reasons. Cooperative groups, for example, may tend to compete against each other<sup>8</sup>. Whereas repeated interactions and group competitions do not support cooperation by themselves, combining them triggers powerful synergies because group competitions constrain the corrosive effect of ambiguous reciprocity. Evolved strategies often consist of cooperative reciprocity with ingroup partners and uncooperative reciprocity with outgroup partners. Results from a behavioural experiment in Papua New Guinea fit exactly this pattern. They thus suggest neither an evolutionary history of repeated interactions without group competition nor a history of group competition without repeated interactions. Instead, our results suggest social motives that evolved under the joint influence of both mechanisms.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07077-w
Nature,2024-Feb,Progressive unanchoring of Antarctic ice shelves since 1973.,"Mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been driven primarily by the thinning of the floating ice shelves that fringe the ice sheet<sup>1</sup>, reducing their buttressing potential and causing land ice to accelerate into the ocean<sup>2</sup>. Observations of ice-shelf thickness change by satellite altimetry stretch back only to 1992 (refs. <sup>1,3-5</sup>) and previous information about thinning remains unquantified. However, extending the record of ice-shelf thickness change is possible by proxy, by measuring the change in area of the surface expression of pinning points-local bathymetric highs on which ice shelves are anchored<sup>6</sup>. Here we measure pinning-point change over three epochs spanning the periods 1973-1989, 1989-2000 and 2000-2022, and thus by proxy infer changes to ice-shelf thickness back to 1973-1989. We show that only small localized pockets of ice shelves were thinning between 1973 and 1989, located primarily in the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the Wilkes Land coastline. Ice-shelf thinning spreads rapidly into the 1990s and 2000s and is best characterized by the proportion of pinning points reducing in extent. Only 15% of pinning points reduced from 1973 to 1989, before increasing to 25% from 1989 to 2000 and 37% from 2000 to 2022. A continuation of this trend would further reduce the buttressing potential of ice shelves, enhancing ice discharge and accelerating the contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07049-0
Nature,2024-Feb,Directive giant upconversion by supercritical bound states in the continuum.,"Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs), embedded in the spectrum of free-space waves<sup>1,2</sup> with diverging radiative quality factor, are topologically non-trivial dark modes in open-cavity resonators that have enabled important advances in photonics<sup>3,4</sup>. However, it is particularly challenging to achieve maximum near-field enhancement, as this requires matching radiative and non-radiative losses. Here we propose the concept of supercritical coupling, drawing inspiration from electromagnetically induced transparency in near-field coupled resonances close to the Friedrich-Wintgen condition<sup>2</sup>. Supercritical coupling occurs when the near-field coupling between dark and bright modes compensates for the negligible direct far-field coupling with the dark mode. This enables a quasi-BIC field to reach maximum enhancement imposed by non-radiative loss, even when the radiative quality factor is divergent. Our experimental design consists of a photonic-crystal nanoslab covered with upconversion nanoparticles. Near-field coupling is finely tuned at the nanostructure edge, in which a coherent upconversion luminescence enhanced by eight orders of magnitude is observed. The emission shows negligible divergence, narrow width at the microscale and controllable directivity through input focusing and polarization. This approach is relevant to various physical processes, with potential applications for light-source development, energy harvesting and photochemical catalysis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06967-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Twisted-layer boron nitride ceramic with high deformability and strength.,"Moiré superlattices formed by twisted stacking in van der Waals materials have emerged as a new platform for exploring the physics of strongly correlated materials and other emergent phenomena<sup>1-5</sup>. However, there remains a lack of research on the mechanical properties of twisted-layer van der Waals materials, owing to a lack of suitable strategies for making three-dimensional bulk materials. Here we report the successful synthesis of a polycrystalline boron nitride bulk ceramic with high room-temperature deformability and strength. This ceramic, synthesized from an onion-like boron nitride nanoprecursor with conventional spark plasma sintering and hot-pressing sintering, consists of interlocked laminated nanoplates in which parallel laminae are stacked with varying twist angles. The compressive strain of this bulk ceramic can reach 14% before fracture, about one order of magnitude higher compared with traditional ceramics (less than 1% in general), whereas the compressive strength is about six times that of ordinary hexagonal boron nitride layered ceramics. The exceptional mechanical properties are due to a combination of the elevated intrinsic deformability of the twisted layering in the nanoplates and the three-dimensional interlocked architecture that restricts deformation from propagating across individual nanoplates. The advent of this twisted-layer boron nitride bulk ceramic opens a gate to the fabrication of highly deformable bulk ceramics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07036-5
Nature,2024-Feb,A 3D nanoscale optical disk memory with petabit capacity.,"High-capacity storage technologies are needed to meet our ever-growing data demands<sup>1,2</sup>. However, data centres based on major storage technologies such as semiconductor flash devices and hard disk drives have high energy burdens, high operation costs and short lifespans<sup>2,3</sup>. Optical data storage (ODS) presents a promising solution for cost-effective long-term archival data storage. Nonetheless, ODS has been limited by its low capacity and the challenge of increasing its areal density<sup>4,5</sup>. Here, to address these issues, we increase the capacity of ODS to the petabit level by extending the planar recording architecture to three dimensions with hundreds of layers, meanwhile breaking the optical diffraction limit barrier of the recorded spots. We develop an optical recording medium based on a photoresist film doped with aggregation-induced emission dye, which can be optically stimulated by femtosecond laser beams. This film is highly transparent and uniform, and the aggregation-induced emission phenomenon provides the storage mechanism. It can also be inhibited by another deactivating beam, resulting in a recording spot with a super-resolution scale. This technology makes it possible to achieve exabit-level storage by stacking nanoscale disks into arrays, which is essential in big data centres with limited space.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y
Nature,2024-Feb,Avoiding fusion plasma tearing instability with deep reinforcement learning.,"For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance<sup>1-4</sup>. However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators<sup>5</sup>. Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention. We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D<sup>6</sup>, the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavourable conditions of low safety factor and low torque. In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07024-9
Nature,2024-Feb,A lanthanide-rich kilonova in the aftermath of a long gamma-ray burst.,"Observationally, kilonovae are astrophysical transients powered by the radioactive decay of nuclei heavier than iron, thought to be synthesized in the merger of two compact objects<sup>1-4</sup>. Over the first few days, the kilonova evolution is dominated by a large number of radioactive isotopes contributing to the heating rate<sup>2,5</sup>. On timescales of weeks to months, its behaviour is predicted to differ depending on the ejecta composition and the merger remnant<sup>6-8</sup>. Previous work has shown that the kilonova associated with gamma-ray burst 230307A is similar to kilonova AT2017gfo (ref. <sup>9</sup>), and mid-infrared spectra revealed an emission line at 2.15 micrometres that was attributed to tellurium. Here we report a multi-wavelength analysis, including publicly available James Webb Space Telescope data<sup>9</sup> and our own Hubble Space Telescope data, for the same gamma-ray burst. We model its evolution up to two months after the burst and show that, at these late times, the recession of the photospheric radius and the rapidly decaying bolometric luminosity (L<sub>bol</sub> ∝ t<sup>-2.7±0.4</sup>, where t is time) support the recombination of lanthanide-rich ejecta as they cool.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06979-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in multilayer graphene.,"The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE), the analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect<sup>1</sup> at zero magnetic field, is predicted to exist in topological flat bands under spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking<sup>2-6</sup>. The demonstration of FQAHE could lead to non-Abelian anyons that form the basis of topological quantum computation<sup>7-9</sup>. So far, FQAHE has been observed only in twisted MoTe<sub>2</sub> at a moiré filling factor v > 1/2 (refs. <sup>10-13</sup>). Graphene-based moiré superlattices are believed to host FQAHE with the potential advantage of superior material quality and higher electron mobility. Here we report the observation of integer and fractional QAH effects in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moiré superlattice. At zero magnetic field, we observed plateaus of quantized Hall resistance [Formula: see text] at v = 1, 2/3, 3/5, 4/7, 4/9, 3/7 and 2/5 of the moiré superlattice, respectively, accompanied by clear dips in the longitudinal resistance R<sub>xx</sub>. R<sub>xy</sub> equals [Formula: see text] at v = 1/2 and varies linearly with v, similar to the composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled lowest Landau level at high magnetic fields<sup>14-16</sup>. By tuning the gate-displacement field D and v, we observed phase transitions from composite Fermi liquid and FQAH states to other correlated electron states. Our system provides an ideal platform for exploring charge fractionalization and (non-Abelian) anyonic braiding at zero magnetic field<sup>7-9,17-19</sup>, especially considering a lateral junction between FQAHE and superconducting regions in the same device<sup>20-22</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07010-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Natural killer cell therapies.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system. A key feature of NK cells is their ability to recognize a wide range of cells in distress, particularly tumour cells and cells infected with viruses. They combine both direct effector functions against their cellular targets and participate in the generation, shaping and maintenance of a multicellular immune response. As our understanding has deepened, several therapeutic strategies focused on NK cells have been conceived and are currently in various stages of development, from preclinical investigations to clinical trials. Here we explore in detail the complexity of NK cell biology in humans and highlight the role of these cells in cancer immunity. We also analyse the harnessing of NK cell immunity through immune checkpoint inhibitors, NK cell engagers, and infusions of preactivated or genetically modified, autologous or allogeneic NK cell products.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06945-1
Nature,2024-Feb,Rapid spin changes around a magnetar fast radio burst.,"Magnetars are neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields (≳10<sup>14</sup> gauss) that exhibit various X-ray phenomena such as sporadic subsecond bursts, long-term persistent flux enhancements and variable rotation-period derivative<sup>1,2</sup>. In 2020, a fast radio burst (FRB), akin to cosmological millisecond-duration radio bursts, was detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (refs. <sup>3-5</sup>), confirming the long-suspected association between some FRBs and magnetars. However, the mechanism for FRB generation in magnetars remains unclear. Here we report the X-ray observation of two glitches in SGR 1935+2154 within a time interval of approximately nine hours, bracketing an FRB that occurred on 14 October 2022<sup>6,7</sup>. Each glitch involved a significant increase in the magnetar's spin frequency, being among the largest abrupt changes in neutron-star rotation<sup>8-10</sup> observed so far. Between the glitches, the magnetar exhibited a rapid spin-down phase, accompanied by an increase and subsequent decline in its persistent X-ray emission and burst rate. We postulate that a strong, ephemeral, magnetospheric wind<sup>11</sup> provides the torque that rapidly slows the star's rotation. The trigger for the first glitch couples the star's crust to its magnetosphere, enhances the various X-ray signals and spawns the wind that alters magnetospheric conditions that might produce the FRB.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07012-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Room-temperature quantum optomechanics using an ultralow noise cavity.,"At room temperature, mechanical motion driven by the quantum backaction of light has been observed only in pioneering experiments in which an optical restoring force controls the oscillator stiffness<sup>1,2</sup>. For solid-state mechanical resonators in which oscillations are controlled by the material rigidity, the observation of these effects has been hindered by low mechanical quality factors, optical cavity frequency fluctuations<sup>3</sup>, thermal intermodulation noise<sup>4,5</sup> and photothermal instabilities. Here we overcome these challenges with a phononic-engineered membrane-in-the-middle system. By using phononic-crystal-patterned cavity mirrors, we reduce the cavity frequency noise by more than 700-fold. In this ultralow noise cavity, we insert a membrane resonator with high thermal conductance and a quality factor (Q) of 180 million, engineered using recently developed soft-clamping techniques<sup>6,7</sup>. These advances enable the operation of the system within a factor of 2.5 of the Heisenberg limit for displacement sensing<sup>8</sup>, leading to the squeezing of the probe laser by 1.09(1) dB below the vacuum fluctuations. Moreover, the long thermal decoherence time of the membrane oscillator (30 vibrational periods) enables us to prepare conditional displaced thermal states of motion with an occupation of 0.97(2) phonons using a multimode Kalman filter. Our work extends the quantum control of solid-state macroscopic oscillators to room temperature.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06997-3
Nature,2024-Feb,Non-Abelian topological order and anyons on a trapped-ion processor.,"Non-Abelian topological order is a coveted state of matter with remarkable properties, including quasiparticles that can remember the sequence in which they are exchanged<sup>1-4</sup>. These anyonic excitations are promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers<sup>5,6</sup>. However, despite extensive efforts, non-Abelian topological order and its excitations have remained elusive, unlike the simpler quasiparticles or defects in Abelian topological order. Here we present the realization of non-Abelian topological order in the wavefunction prepared in a quantum processor and demonstrate control of its anyons. Using an adaptive circuit on Quantinuum's H2 trapped-ion quantum processor, we create the ground-state wavefunction of D<sub>4</sub> topological order on a kagome lattice of 27 qubits, with fidelity per site exceeding 98.4 per cent. By creating and moving anyons along Borromean rings in spacetime, anyon interferometry detects an intrinsically non-Abelian braiding process. Furthermore, tunnelling non-Abelions around a torus creates all 22 ground states, as well as an excited state with a single anyon-a peculiar feature of non-Abelian topological order. This work illustrates the counterintuitive nature of non-Abelions and enables their study in quantum devices.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06934-4
Nature,2024-Feb,Observation of plaid-like spin splitting in a noncoplanar antiferromagnet.,"Spatial, momentum and energy separation of electronic spins in condensed-matter systems guides the development of new devices in which spin-polarized current is generated and manipulated<sup>1-3</sup>. Recent attention on a set of previously overlooked symmetry operations in magnetic materials<sup>4</sup> leads to the emergence of a new type of spin splitting, enabling giant and momentum-dependent spin polarization of energy bands on selected antiferromagnets<sup>5-10</sup>. Despite the ever-growing theoretical predictions, the direct spectroscopic proof of such spin splitting is still lacking. Here we provide solid spectroscopic and computational evidence for the existence of such materials. In the noncoplanar antiferromagnet manganese ditelluride (MnTe<sub>2</sub>), the in-plane components of spin are found to be antisymmetric about the high-symmetry planes of the Brillouin zone, comprising a plaid-like spin texture in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Such an unconventional spin pattern, further found to diminish at the high-temperature paramagnetic state, originates from the intrinsic AFM order instead of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Our finding demonstrates a new type of quadratic spin texture induced by time-reversal breaking, placing AFM spintronics on a firm basis and paving the way for studying exotic quantum phenomena in related materials.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07023-w
Nature,2024-Feb,A 2D ferroelectric vortex pattern in twisted BaTiO<sub>3</sub> freestanding layers.,"The wealth of complex polar topologies<sup>1-10</sup> recently found in nanoscale ferroelectrics results from a delicate balance between the intrinsic tendency of the materials to develop a homogeneous polarization and the electric and mechanical boundary conditions imposed on them. Ferroelectric-dielectric interfaces are model systems in which polarization curling originates from open circuit-like electric boundary conditions, to avoid the build-up of polarization charges through the formation of flux-closure<sup>11-14</sup> domains that evolve into vortex-like structures at the nanoscale<sup>15-17</sup> level. Although ferroelectricity is known to couple strongly with strain (both homogeneous<sup>18</sup> and inhomogeneous<sup>19,20</sup>), the effect of mechanical constraints<sup>21</sup> on thin-film nanoscale ferroelectrics has been comparatively less explored because of the relative paucity of strain patterns that can be implemented experimentally. Here we show that the stacking of freestanding ferroelectric perovskite layers with controlled twist angles provides an opportunity to tailor these topological nanostructures in a way determined by the lateral strain modulation associated with the twisting. Furthermore, we find that a peculiar pattern of polarization vortices and antivortices emerges from the flexoelectric coupling of polarization to strain gradients. This finding provides opportunities to create two-dimensional high-density vortex crystals that would enable us to explore previously unknown physical effects and functionalities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06978-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Altermagnetic lifting of Kramers spin degeneracy.,"Lifted Kramers spin degeneracy (LKSD) has been among the central topics of condensed-matter physics since the dawn of the band theory of solids<sup>1,2</sup>. It underpins established practical applications as well as current frontier research, ranging from magnetic-memory technology<sup>3-7</sup> to topological quantum matter<sup>8-14</sup>. Traditionally, LKSD has been considered to originate from two possible internal symmetry-breaking mechanisms. The first refers to time-reversal symmetry breaking by magnetization of ferromagnets and tends to be strong because of the non-relativistic exchange origin<sup>15</sup>. The second applies to crystals with broken inversion symmetry and tends to be comparatively weaker, as it originates from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC)<sup>16-19</sup>. A recent theory work based on spin-symmetry classification has identified an unconventional magnetic phase, dubbed altermagnetic<sup>20,21</sup>, that allows for LKSD without net magnetization and inversion-symmetry breaking. Here we provide the confirmation using photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. We identify two distinct unconventional mechanisms of LKSD generated by the altermagnetic phase of centrosymmetric MnTe with vanishing net magnetization<sup>20-23</sup>. Our observation of the altermagnetic LKSD can have broad consequences in magnetism. It motivates exploration and exploitation of the unconventional nature of this magnetic phase in an extended family of materials, ranging from insulators and semiconductors to metals and superconductors<sup>20,21</sup>, that have been either identified recently or perceived for many decades as conventional antiferromagnets<sup>21,24,25</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06907-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Critical transitions in the Amazon forest system.,"The possibility that the Amazon forest system could soon reach a tipping point, inducing large-scale collapse, has raised global concern<sup>1-3</sup>. For 65 million years, Amazonian forests remained relatively resilient to climatic variability. Now, the region is increasingly exposed to unprecedented stress from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires, even in central and remote parts of the system<sup>1</sup>. Long existing feedbacks between the forest and environmental conditions are being replaced by novel feedbacks that modify ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk of critical transition. Here we analyse existing evidence for five major drivers of water stress on Amazonian forests, as well as potential critical thresholds of those drivers that, if crossed, could trigger local, regional or even biome-wide forest collapse. By combining spatial information on various disturbances, we estimate that by 2050, 10% to 47% of Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and potentially exacerbate regional climate change. Using examples of disturbed forests across the Amazon, we identify the three most plausible ecosystem trajectories, involving different feedbacks and environmental conditions. We discuss how the inherent complexity of the Amazon adds uncertainty about future dynamics, but also reveals opportunities for action. Keeping the Amazon forest resilient in the Anthropocene will depend on a combination of local efforts to end deforestation and degradation and to expand restoration, with global efforts to stop greenhouse gas emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06970-0
Nature,2024-Feb,Optimally generate policy-based evidence before scaling.,"Social scientists have increasingly turned to the experimental method to understand human behaviour. One critical issue that makes solving social problems difficult is scaling up the idea from a small group to a larger group in more diverse situations. The urgency of scaling policies impacts us every day, whether it is protecting the health and safety of a community or enhancing the opportunities of future generations. Yet, a common result is that, when we scale up ideas, most experience a 'voltage drop'-that is, on scaling, the cost-benefit profile depreciates considerably. Here I argue that, to reduce voltage drops, we must optimally generate policy-based evidence. Optimality requires answering two crucial questions: what information should be generated and in what sequence. The economics underlying the science of scaling provides insights into these questions, which are in some cases at odds with conventional approaches. For example, there are important situations in which I advocate flipping the traditional social science research model to an approach that, from the beginning, produces the type of policy-based evidence that the science of scaling demands. To do so, I propose augmenting efficacy trials by including relevant tests of scale in the original discovery process, which forces the scientist to naturally start with a recognition of the big picture: what information do I need to have scaling confidence?",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06972-y
Nature,2024-Feb,Autonomous transposons tune their sequences to ensure somatic suppression.,"Transposable elements (TEs) are a major constituent of human genes, occupying approximately half of the intronic space. During pre-messenger RNA synthesis, intronic TEs are transcribed along with their host genes but rarely contribute to the final mRNA product because they are spliced out together with the intron and rapidly degraded. Paradoxically, TEs are an abundant source of RNA-processing signals through which they can create new introns<sup>1</sup>, and also functional<sup>2</sup> or non-functional chimeric transcripts<sup>3</sup>. The rarity of these events implies the existence of a resilient splicing code that is able to suppress TE exonization without compromising host pre-mRNA processing. Here we show that SAFB proteins protect genome integrity by preventing retrotransposition of L1 elements while maintaining splicing integrity, via prevention of the exonization of previously integrated TEs. This unique dual role is possible because of L1's conserved adenosine-rich coding sequences that are bound by SAFB proteins. The suppressive activity of SAFB extends to tissue-specific, giant protein-coding cassette exons, nested genes and Tigger DNA transposons. Moreover, SAFB also suppresses LTR/ERV elements in species in which they are still active, such as mice and flies. A significant subset of splicing events suppressed by SAFB in somatic cells are activated in the testis, coinciding with low SAFB expression in postmeiotic spermatids. Reminiscent of the division of labour between innate and adaptive immune systems that fight external pathogens, our results uncover SAFB proteins as an RNA-based, pattern-guided, non-adaptive defence system against TEs in the soma, complementing the RNA-based, adaptive Piwi-interacting RNA pathway of the germline.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07081-0
Nature,2024-Feb,Online images amplify gender bias.,"Each year, people spend less time reading and more time viewing images<sup>1</sup>, which are proliferating online<sup>2-4</sup>. Images from platforms such as Google and Wikipedia are downloaded by millions every day<sup>2,5,6</sup>, and millions more are interacting through social media, such as Instagram and TikTok, that primarily consist of exchanging visual content. In parallel, news agencies and digital advertisers are increasingly capturing attention online through the use of images<sup>7,8</sup>, which people process more quickly, implicitly and memorably than text<sup>9-12</sup>. Here we show that the rise of images online significantly exacerbates gender bias, both in its statistical prevalence and its psychological impact. We examine the gender associations of 3,495 social categories (such as 'nurse' or 'banker') in more than one million images from Google, Wikipedia and Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and in billions of words from these platforms. We find that gender bias is consistently more prevalent in images than text for both female- and male-typed categories. We also show that the documented underrepresentation of women online<sup>13-18</sup> is substantially worse in images than in text, public opinion and US census data. Finally, we conducted a nationally representative, preregistered experiment that shows that googling for images rather than textual descriptions of occupations amplifies gender bias in participants' beliefs. Addressing the societal effect of this large-scale shift towards visual communication will be essential for developing a fair and inclusive future for the internet.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07068-x
Nature,2024-Feb,A single-cell time-lapse of mouse prenatal development from gastrula to birth.,"The house mouse (Mus musculus) is an exceptional model system, combining genetic tractability with close evolutionary affinity to humans<sup>1,2</sup>. Mouse gestation lasts only 3 weeks, during which the genome orchestrates the astonishing transformation of a single-cell zygote into a free-living pup composed of more than 500 million cells. Here, to establish a global framework for exploring mammalian development, we applied optimized single-cell combinatorial indexing<sup>3</sup> to profile the transcriptional states of 12.4 million nuclei from 83 embryos, precisely staged at 2- to 6-hour intervals spanning late gastrulation (embryonic day 8) to birth (postnatal day 0). From these data, we annotate hundreds of cell types and explore the ontogenesis of the posterior embryo during somitogenesis and of kidney, mesenchyme, retina and early neurons. We leverage the temporal resolution and sampling depth of these whole-embryo snapshots, together with published data<sup>4-8</sup> from earlier timepoints, to construct a rooted tree of cell-type relationships that spans the entirety of prenatal development, from zygote to birth. Throughout this tree, we systematically nominate genes encoding transcription factors and other proteins as candidate drivers of the in vivo differentiation of hundreds of cell types. Remarkably, the most marked temporal shifts in cell states are observed within one hour of birth and presumably underlie the massive physiological adaptations that must accompany the successful transition of a mammalian fetus to life outside the womb.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07069-w
Nature,2024-Feb,A new family of bacterial ribosome hibernation factors.,"To conserve energy during starvation and stress, many organisms use hibernation factor proteins to inhibit protein synthesis and protect their ribosomes from damage<sup>1,2</sup>. In bacteria, two families of hibernation factors have been described, but the low conservation of these proteins and the huge diversity of species, habitats and environmental stressors have confounded their discovery<sup>3-6</sup>. Here, by combining cryogenic electron microscopy, genetics and biochemistry, we identify Balon, a new hibernation factor in the cold-adapted bacterium Psychrobacter urativorans. We show that Balon is a distant homologue of the archaeo-eukaryotic translation factor aeRF1 and is found in 20% of representative bacteria. During cold shock or stationary phase, Balon occupies the ribosomal A site in both vacant and actively translating ribosomes in complex with EF-Tu, highlighting an unexpected role for EF-Tu in the cellular stress response. Unlike typical A-site substrates, Balon binds to ribosomes in an mRNA-independent manner, initiating a new mode of ribosome hibernation that can commence while ribosomes are still engaged in protein synthesis. Our work suggests that Balon-EF-Tu-regulated ribosome hibernation is a ubiquitous bacterial stress-response mechanism, and we demonstrate that putative Balon homologues in Mycobacteria bind to ribosomes in a similar fashion. This finding calls for a revision of the current model of ribosome hibernation inferred from common model organisms and holds numerous implications for how we understand and study ribosome hibernation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07041-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Bone marrow plasma cells require P2RX4 to sense extracellular ATP.,"Plasma cells produce large quantities of antibodies and so play essential roles in immune protection<sup>1</sup>. Plasma cells, including a long-lived subset, reside in the bone marrow where they depend on poorly defined microenvironment-linked survival signals<sup>1</sup>. We show that bone marrow plasma cells use the ligand-gated purinergic ion channel P2RX4 to sense extracellular ATP released by bone marrow osteoblasts through the gap-junction protein pannexin 3 (PANX3). Mutation of Panx3 or P2rx4 each caused decreased serum antibodies and selective loss of bone marrow plasma cells. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, PANX3-null osteoblasts secreted less extracellular ATP and failed to support plasma cells in vitro. The P2RX4-specific inhibitor 5-BDBD abrogated the impact of extracellular ATP on bone marrow plasma cells in vitro, depleted bone marrow plasma cells in vivo and reduced pre-induced antigen-specific serum antibody titre with little posttreatment rebound. P2RX4 blockade also reduced autoantibody titre and kidney disease in two mouse models of humoral autoimmunity. P2RX4 promotes plasma cell survival by regulating endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, as short-term P2RX4 blockade caused accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated regulatory proteins including ATF4 and B-lineage mutation of the pro-apoptotic ATF4 target Chop prevented bone marrow plasma cell demise on P2RX4 inhibition. Thus, generating mature protective and pathogenic plasma cells requires P2RX4 signalling controlled by PANX3-regulated extracellular ATP release from bone marrow niche cells.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07047-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Influence of pump laser fluence on ultrafast myoglobin structural dynamics.,"High-intensity femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser enable pump-probe experiments for the investigation of electronic and nuclear changes during light-induced reactions. On timescales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds and for a variety of biological systems, time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) has provided detailed structural data for light-induced isomerization, breakage or formation of chemical bonds and electron transfer<sup>1,2</sup>. However, all ultrafast TR-SFX studies to date have employed such high pump laser energies that nominally several photons were absorbed per chromophore<sup>3-17</sup>. As multiphoton absorption may force the protein response into non-physiological pathways, it is of great concern<sup>18,19</sup> whether this experimental approach<sup>20</sup> allows valid conclusions to be drawn vis-à-vis biologically relevant single-photon-induced reactions<sup>18,19</sup>. Here we describe ultrafast pump-probe SFX experiments on the photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin, showing that different pump laser fluences yield markedly different results. In particular, the dynamics of structural changes and observed indicators of the mechanistically important coherent oscillations of the Fe-CO bond distance (predicted by recent quantum wavepacket dynamics<sup>21</sup>) are seen to depend strongly on pump laser energy, in line with quantum chemical analysis. Our results confirm both the feasibility and necessity of performing ultrafast TR-SFX pump-probe experiments in the linear photoexcitation regime. We consider this to be a starting point for reassessing both the design and the interpretation of ultrafast TR-SFX pump-probe experiments<sup>20</sup> such that mechanistically relevant insight emerges.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07032-9
Nature,2024-Feb,A model of human neural networks reveals NPTX2 pathology in ALS and FTLD.,"Human cellular models of neurodegeneration require reproducibility and longevity, which is necessary for simulating age-dependent diseases. Such systems are particularly needed for TDP-43 proteinopathies<sup>1</sup>, which involve human-specific mechanisms<sup>2-5</sup> that cannot be directly studied in animal models. Here, to explore the emergence and consequences of TDP-43 pathologies, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived, colony morphology neural stem cells (iCoMoNSCs) via manual selection of neural precursors<sup>6</sup>. Single-cell transcriptomics and comparison to independent neural stem cells<sup>7</sup> showed that iCoMoNSCs are uniquely homogenous and self-renewing. Differentiated iCoMoNSCs formed a self-organized multicellular system consisting of synaptically connected and electrophysiologically active neurons, which matured into long-lived functional networks (which we designate iNets). Neuronal and glial maturation in iNets was similar to that of cortical organoids<sup>8</sup>. Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 in a minority of neurons within iNets led to progressive fragmentation and aggregation of the protein, resulting in a partial loss of function and neurotoxicity. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a novel set of misregulated RNA targets in TDP-43-overexpressing neurons and in patients with TDP-43 proteinopathies exhibiting a loss of nuclear TDP-43. The strongest misregulated target encoded the synaptic protein NPTX2, the levels of which are controlled by TDP-43 binding on its 3' untranslated region. When NPTX2 was overexpressed in iNets, it exhibited neurotoxicity, whereas correcting NPTX2 misregulation partially rescued neurons from TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration. Notably, NPTX2 was consistently misaccumulated in neurons from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology. Our work directly links TDP-43 misregulation and NPTX2 accumulation, thereby revealing a TDP-43-dependent pathway of neurotoxicity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07042-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Smoking changes adaptive immunity with persistent effects.,"Individuals differ widely in their immune responses, with age, sex and genetic factors having major roles in this inherent variability<sup>1-6</sup>. However, the variables that drive such differences in cytokine secretion-a crucial component of the host response to immune challenges-remain poorly defined. Here we investigated 136 variables and identified smoking, cytomegalovirus latent infection and body mass index as major contributors to variability in cytokine response, with effects of comparable magnitudes with age, sex and genetics. We find that smoking influences both innate and adaptive immune responses. Notably, its effect on innate responses is quickly lost after smoking cessation and is specifically associated with plasma levels of CEACAM6, whereas its effect on adaptive responses persists long after individuals quit smoking and is associated with epigenetic memory. This is supported by the association of the past smoking effect on cytokine responses with DNA methylation at specific signal trans-activators and regulators of metabolism. Our findings identify three novel variables associated with cytokine secretion variability and reveal roles for smoking in the short- and long-term regulation of immune responses. These results have potential clinical implications for the risk of developing infections, cancers or autoimmune diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06968-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Circulating myeloid-derived MMP8 in stress susceptibility and depression.,"Psychosocial stress has profound effects on the body, including the immune system and the brain<sup>1,2</sup>. Although a large number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have linked peripheral immune system alterations to stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD)<sup>3</sup>, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that expression of a circulating myeloid cell-specific proteinase, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), is increased in the serum of humans with MDD as well as in stress-susceptible mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In mice, we show that this increase leads to alterations in extracellular space and neurophysiological changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as well as altered social behaviour. Using a combination of mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we performed high-dimensional phenotyping of immune cells in circulation and in the brain and demonstrate that peripheral monocytes are strongly affected by stress. In stress-susceptible mice, both circulating monocytes and monocytes that traffic to the brain showed increased Mmp8 expression following chronic social defeat stress. We further demonstrate that circulating MMP8 directly infiltrates the NAc parenchyma and controls the ultrastructure of the extracellular space. Depleting MMP8 prevented stress-induced social avoidance behaviour and alterations in NAc neurophysiology and extracellular space. Collectively, these data establish a mechanism by which peripheral immune factors can affect central nervous system function and behaviour in the context of stress. Targeting specific peripheral immune cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases could constitute novel therapeutic targets for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07015-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Transforming a head direction signal into a goal-oriented steering command.,"To navigate, we must continuously estimate the direction we are headed in, and we must correct deviations from our goal<sup>1</sup>. Direction estimation is accomplished by ring attractor networks in the head direction system<sup>2,3</sup>. However, we do not fully understand how the sense of direction is used to guide action. Drosophila connectome analyses<sup>4,5</sup> reveal three cell populations (PFL3R, PFL3L and PFL2) that connect the head direction system to the locomotor system. Here we use imaging, electrophysiology and chemogenetic stimulation during navigation to show how these populations function. Each population receives a shifted copy of the head direction vector, such that their three reference frames are shifted approximately 120° relative to each other. Each cell type then compares its own head direction vector with a common goal vector; specifically, it evaluates the congruence of these vectors via a nonlinear transformation. The output of all three cell populations is then combined to generate locomotor commands. PFL3R cells are recruited when the fly is oriented to the left of its goal, and their activity drives rightward turning; the reverse is true for PFL3L. Meanwhile, PFL2 cells increase steering speed, and are recruited when the fly is oriented far from its goal. PFL2 cells adaptively increase the strength of steering as directional error increases, effectively managing the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Together, our results show how a map of space in the brain can be combined with an internal goal to generate action commands, via a transformation from world-centric coordinates to body-centric coordinates.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07039-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Allosteric modulation and G-protein selectivity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing receptor.,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a family C G-protein-coupled receptor<sup>1</sup> (GPCR) that has a central role in regulating systemic calcium homeostasis<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays to investigate the activation of human CaSR embedded in lipid nanodiscs and its coupling to functional G<sub>i</sub> versus G<sub>q</sub> proteins in the presence and absence of the calcimimetic drug cinacalcet. High-resolution structures show that both G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> drive additional conformational changes in the activated CaSR dimer to stabilize a more extensive asymmetric interface of the seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) that involves key protein-lipid interactions. Selective G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> coupling by the receptor is achieved through substantial rearrangements of intracellular loop 2 and the C terminus, which contribute differentially towards the binding of the two G-protein subtypes, resulting in distinct CaSR-G-protein interfaces. The structures also reveal that natural polyamines target multiple sites on CaSR to enhance receptor activation by zipping negatively charged regions between two protomers. Furthermore, we find that the amino acid L-tryptophan, a well-known ligand of CaSR extracellular domains, occupies the 7TM bundle of the G-protein-coupled protomer at the same location as cinacalcet and other allosteric modulators. Together, these results provide a framework for G-protein activation and selectivity by CaSR, as well as its allosteric modulation by endogenous and exogenous ligands.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07055-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Light-driven nanoscale vectorial currents.,"Controlled charge flows are fundamental to many areas of science and technology, serving as carriers of energy and information, as probes of material properties and dynamics<sup>1</sup> and as a means of revealing<sup>2,3</sup> or even inducing<sup>4,5</sup> broken symmetries. Emerging methods for light-based current control<sup>5-16</sup> offer particularly promising routes beyond the speed and adaptability limitations of conventional voltage-driven systems. However, optical generation and manipulation of currents at nanometre spatial scales remains a basic challenge and a crucial step towards scalable optoelectronic systems for microelectronics and information science. Here we introduce vectorial optoelectronic metasurfaces in which ultrafast light pulses induce local directional charge flows around symmetry-broken plasmonic nanostructures, with tunable responses and arbitrary patterning down to subdiffractive nanometre scales. Local symmetries and vectorial currents are revealed by polarization-dependent and wavelength-sensitive electrical readout and terahertz (THz) emission, whereas spatially tailored global currents are demonstrated in the direct generation of elusive broadband THz vector beams<sup>17</sup>. We show that, in graphene, a detailed interplay between electrodynamic, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic degrees of freedom gives rise to rapidly evolving nanoscale driving forces and charge flows under the extremely spatially and temporally localized excitation. These results set the stage for versatile patterning and optical control over nanoscale currents in materials diagnostics, THz spectroscopies, nanomagnetism and ultrafast information processing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07037-4
Nature,2024-Feb,Structural basis of ribosomal 30S subunit degradation by RNase R.,"Protein synthesis is a major energy-consuming process of the cell that requires the controlled production<sup>1-3</sup> and turnover<sup>4,5</sup> of ribosomes. Although the past few years have seen major advances in our understanding of ribosome biogenesis, structural insight into the degradation of ribosomes has been lacking. Here we present native structures of two distinct small ribosomal 30S subunit degradation intermediates associated with the 3' to 5' exonuclease ribonuclease R (RNase R). The structures reveal that RNase R binds at first to the 30S platform to facilitate the degradation of the functionally important anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the decoding-site helix 44. RNase R then encounters a roadblock when it reaches the neck region of the 30S subunit, and this is overcome by a major structural rearrangement of the 30S head, involving the loss of ribosomal proteins. RNase R parallels this movement and relocates to the decoding site by using its N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain as an anchor. In vitro degradation assays suggest that head rearrangement poses a major kinetic barrier for RNase R, but also indicate that the enzyme alone is sufficient for complete degradation of 30S subunits. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic basis for the degradation of 30S mediated by RNase R, and reveal that RNase R targets orphaned 30S subunits using a dynamic mechanism involving an anchored switching of binding sites.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07027-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Signatures of a surface spin-orbital chiral metal.,"The relation between crystal symmetries, electron correlations and electronic structure steers the formation of a large array of unconventional phases of matter, including magneto-electric loop currents and chiral magnetism<sup>1-6</sup>. The detection of such hidden orders is an important goal in condensed-matter physics. However, until now, non-standard forms of magnetism with chiral electronic ordering have been difficult to detect experimentally<sup>7</sup>. Here we develop a theory for symmetry-broken chiral ground states and propose a methodology based on circularly polarized, spin-selective, angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to study them. We use the archetypal quantum material Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> and reveal spectroscopic signatures that, despite being subtle, can be reconciled with the formation of spin-orbital chiral currents at the surface of the material<sup>8-10</sup>. As we shed light on these chiral regimes, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of ordering phenomena and unconventional magnetism.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07033-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Convergence of coronary artery disease genes onto endothelial cell programs.,"Linking variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to underlying mechanisms of disease remains a challenge<sup>1-3</sup>. For some diseases, a successful strategy has been to look for cases in which multiple GWAS loci contain genes that act in the same biological pathway<sup>1-6</sup>. However, our knowledge of which genes act in which pathways is incomplete, particularly for cell-type-specific pathways or understudied genes. Here we introduce a method to connect GWAS variants to functions. This method links variants to genes using epigenomics data, links genes to pathways de novo using Perturb-seq and integrates these data to identify convergence of GWAS loci onto pathways. We apply this approach to study the role of endothelial cells in genetic risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), and discover 43 CAD GWAS signals that converge on the cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) signalling pathway. Two regulators of this pathway, CCM2 and TLNRD1, are each linked to a CAD risk variant, regulate other CAD risk genes and affect atheroprotective processes in endothelial cells. These results suggest a model whereby CAD risk is driven in part by the convergence of causal genes onto a particular transcriptional pathway in endothelial cells. They highlight shared genes between common and rare vascular diseases (CAD and CCM), and identify TLNRD1 as a new, previously uncharacterized member of the CCM signalling pathway. This approach will be widely useful for linking variants to functions for other common polygenic diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07022-x
Nature,2024-Feb,Naturally occurring T cell mutations enhance engineered T cell therapies.,"Adoptive T cell therapies have produced exceptional responses in a subset of patients with cancer. However, therapeutic efficacy can be hindered by poor T cell persistence and function<sup>1</sup>. In human T cell cancers, evolution of the disease positively selects for mutations that improve fitness of T cells in challenging situations analogous to those faced by therapeutic T cells. Therefore, we reasoned that these mutations could be co-opted to improve T cell therapies. Here we systematically screened the effects of 71 mutations from T cell neoplasms on T cell signalling, cytokine production and in vivo persistence in tumours. We identify a gene fusion, CARD11-PIK3R3, found in a CD4<sup>+</sup> cutaneous T cell lymphoma<sup>2</sup>, that augments CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex signalling and anti-tumour efficacy of therapeutic T cells in several immunotherapy-refractory models in an antigen-dependent manner. Underscoring its potential to be deployed safely, CARD11-PIK3R3-expressing cells were followed up to 418 days after T cell transfer in vivo without evidence of malignant transformation. Collectively, our results indicate that exploiting naturally occurring mutations represents a promising approach to explore the extremes of T cell biology and discover how solutions derived from evolution of malignant T cells can improve a broad range of T cell therapies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07018-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Converting an allocentric goal into an egocentric steering signal.,"Neuronal signals that are relevant for spatial navigation have been described in many species<sup>1-10</sup>. However, a circuit-level understanding of how such signals interact to guide navigational behaviour is lacking. Here we characterize a neuronal circuit in the Drosophila central complex that compares internally generated estimates of the heading and goal angles of the fly-both of which are encoded in world-centred (allocentric) coordinates-to generate a body-centred (egocentric) steering signal. Past work has suggested that the activity of EPG neurons represents the fly's moment-to-moment angular orientation, or heading angle, during navigation<sup>2,11</sup>. An animal's moment-to-moment heading angle, however, is not always aligned with its goal angle-that is, the allocentric direction in which it wishes to progress forward. We describe FC2 cells<sup>12</sup>, a second set of neurons in the Drosophila brain with activity that correlates with the fly's goal angle. Focal optogenetic activation of FC2 neurons induces flies to orient along experimenter-defined directions as they walk forward. EPG and FC2 neurons connect monosynaptically to a third neuronal class, PFL3 cells<sup>12,13</sup>. We found that individual PFL3 cells show conjunctive, spike-rate tuning to both the heading angle and the goal angle during goal-directed navigation. Informed by the anatomy and physiology of these three cell classes, we develop a model that explains how this circuit compares allocentric heading and goal angles to build an egocentric steering signal in the PFL3 output terminals. Quantitative analyses and optogenetic manipulations of PFL3 activity support the model. Finally, using a new navigational memory task, we show that flies expressing disruptors of synaptic transmission in subsets of PFL3 cells have a reduced ability to orient along arbitrary goal directions, with an effect size in quantitative accordance with the prediction of our model. The biological circuit described here reveals how two population-level allocentric signals are compared in the brain to produce an egocentric output signal that is appropriate for motor control.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07006-3
Nature,2024-Feb,Translation selectively destroys non-functional transcription complexes.,"Transcription elongation stalls at lesions in the DNA template<sup>1</sup>. For the DNA lesion to be repaired, the stalled transcription elongation complex (EC) has to be removed from the damaged site<sup>2</sup>. Here we show that translation, which is coupled to transcription in bacteria, actively dislodges stalled ECs from the damaged DNA template. By contrast, paused, but otherwise elongation-competent, ECs are not dislodged by the ribosome. Instead, they are helped back into processive elongation. We also show that the ribosome slows down when approaching paused, but not stalled, ECs. Our results indicate that coupled ribosomes functionally and kinetically discriminate between paused ECs and stalled ECs, ensuring the selective destruction of only the latter. This functional discrimination is controlled by the RNA polymerase's catalytic domain, the Trigger Loop. We show that the transcription-coupled DNA repair helicase UvrD, proposed to cause backtracking of stalled ECs<sup>3</sup>, does not interfere with ribosome-mediated dislodging. By contrast, the transcription-coupled DNA repair translocase Mfd<sup>4</sup> acts synergistically with translation, and dislodges stalled ECs that were not destroyed by the ribosome. We also show that a coupled ribosome efficiently destroys misincorporated ECs that can cause conflicts with replication<sup>5</sup>. We propose that coupling to translation is an ancient and one of the main mechanisms of clearing non-functional ECs from the genome.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07014-3
Nature,2024-Feb,A distinct cortical code for socially learned threat.,"Animals can learn about sources of danger while minimizing their own risk by observing how others respond to threats. However, the distinct neural mechanisms by which threats are learned through social observation (known as observational fear learning<sup>1-4</sup> (OFL)) to generate behavioural responses specific to such threats remain poorly understood. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) performs several key functions that may underlie OFL, including processing of social information and disambiguation of threat cues<sup>5-11</sup>. Here we show that dmPFC is recruited and required for OFL in mice. Using cellular-resolution microendoscopic calcium imaging, we demonstrate that dmPFC neurons code for observational fear and do so in a manner that is distinct from direct experience. We find that dmPFC neuronal activity predicts upcoming switches between freezing and moving state elicited by threat. By combining neuronal circuit mapping, calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics, we show that dmPFC projections to the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) constrain observer freezing, and that amygdalar and hippocampal inputs to dmPFC opposingly modulate observer freezing. Together our findings reveal that dmPFC neurons compute a distinct code for observational fear and coordinate long-range neural circuits to select behavioural responses.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07008-1
Nature,2024-Feb,Bile salt hydrolase catalyses formation of amine-conjugated bile acids.,"Bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract produce amino acid bile acid amidates that can affect host-mediated metabolic processes<sup>1-6</sup>; however, the bacterial gene(s) responsible for their production remain unknown. Herein, we report that bile salt hydrolase (BSH) possesses dual functions in bile acid metabolism. Specifically, we identified a previously unknown role for BSH as an amine N-acyltransferase that conjugates amines to bile acids, thus forming bacterial bile acid amidates (BBAAs). To characterize this amine N-acyltransferase BSH activity, we used pharmacological inhibition of BSH, heterologous expression of bsh and mutants in Escherichia coli and bsh knockout and complementation in Bacteroides fragilis to demonstrate that BSH generates BBAAs. We further show in a human infant cohort that BBAA production is positively correlated with the colonization of bsh-expressing bacteria. Lastly, we report that in cell culture models, BBAAs activate host ligand-activated transcription factors including the pregnane X receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. These findings enhance our understanding of how gut bacteria, through the promiscuous actions of BSH, have a significant role in regulating the bile acid metabolic network.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06990-w
Nature,2024-Feb,Bile salt hydrolase acyltransferase activity expands bile acid diversity.,"Bile acids (BAs) are steroid detergents in bile that contribute to the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins while shaping the gut microbiome because of their antimicrobial properties<sup>1-4</sup>. Here we identify the enzyme responsible for a mechanism of BA metabolism by the gut microbiota involving amino acid conjugation to the acyl-site of BAs, thus producing a diverse suite of microbially conjugated bile acids (MCBAs). We show that this transformation is mediated by acyltransferase activity of bile salt hydrolase (bile salt hydrolase/transferase, BSH/T). Clostridium perfringens BSH/T rapidly performed acyl transfer when provided various amino acids and taurocholate, glycocholate or cholate, with an optimum at pH 5.3. Amino acid conjugation by C. perfringens BSH/T was diverse, including all proteinaceous amino acids except proline and aspartate. MCBA production was widespread among gut bacteria, with strain-specific amino acid use. Species with similar BSH/T amino acid sequences had similar conjugation profiles and several bsh/t alleles correlated with increased conjugation diversity. Tertiary structure mapping of BSH/T followed by mutagenesis experiments showed that active site structure affects amino acid selectivity. These MCBA products had antimicrobial properties, where greater amino acid hydrophobicity showed greater antimicrobial activity. Inhibitory concentrations of MCBAs reached those measured natively in the mammalian gut. MCBAs fed to mice entered enterohepatic circulation, in which liver and gallbladder concentrations varied depending on the conjugated amino acid. Quantifying MCBAs in human faecal samples showed that they reach concentrations equal to or greater than secondary and primary BAs and were reduced after bariatric surgery, thus supporting MCBAs as a significant component of the BA pool that can be altered by changes in gastrointestinal physiology. In conclusion, the inherent acyltransferase activity of BSH/T greatly diversifies BA chemistry, creating a set of previously underappreciated metabolites with the potential to affect the microbiome and human health.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07017-8
Nature,2024-Feb,The nuclear factor ID3 endows macrophages with a potent anti-tumour activity.,"Macrophage activation is controlled by a balance between activating and inhibitory receptors<sup>1-7</sup>, which protect normal tissues from excessive damage during infection<sup>8,9</sup> but promote tumour growth and metastasis in cancer<sup>7,10</sup>. Here we report that the Kupffer cell lineage-determining factor ID3 controls this balance and selectively endows Kupffer cells with the ability to phagocytose live tumour cells and orchestrate the recruitment, proliferation and activation of natural killer and CD8 T lymphoid effector cells in the liver to restrict the growth of a variety of tumours. ID3 shifts the macrophage inhibitory/activating receptor balance to promote the phagocytic and lymphoid response, at least in part by buffering the binding of the transcription factors ELK1 and E2A at the SIRPA locus. Furthermore, loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that ID3 is sufficient to confer this potent anti-tumour activity to mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived macrophages. Expression of ID3 is therefore necessary and sufficient to endow macrophages with the ability to form an efficient anti-tumour niche, which could be harnessed for cell therapy in cancer.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06950-4
Nature,2024-Feb,Elevated Southern Hemisphere moisture availability during glacial periods.,"Late Pleistocene ice-age climates are routinely characterized as having imposed moisture stress on low- to mid-latitude ecosystems<sup>1-5</sup>. This idea is largely based on fossil pollen evidence for widespread, low-biomass glacial vegetation, interpreted as indicating climatic dryness<sup>6</sup>. However, woody plant growth is inhibited under low atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (refs. <sup>7,8</sup>), so understanding glacial environments requires the development of new palaeoclimate indicators that are independent of vegetation<sup>9</sup>. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, during the past 350 kyr, peaks in southern Australian climatic moisture availability were largely confined to glacial periods, including the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas warm interglacials were relatively dry. By measuring the timing of speleothem growth in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics, which today has a predominantly negative annual moisture balance, we developed a record of climatic moisture availability that is independent of vegetation and extends through multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. Our results demonstrate that a cool-moist response is consistent across the austral subtropics and, in part, may result from reduced evaporation under cool glacial temperatures. Insofar as cold glacial environments in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics have been portrayed as uniformly arid<sup>3,10,11</sup>, our findings suggest that their characterization as evolutionary or physiological obstacles to movement and expansion of animal, plant and, potentially, human populations<sup>10</sup> should be reconsidered.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06989-3
Nature,2024-Feb,Evidence of superconducting Fermi arcs.,"An essential ingredient for the production of Majorana fermions for use in quantum computing is topological superconductivity<sup>1,2</sup>. As bulk topological superconductors remain elusive, the most promising approaches exploit proximity-induced superconductivity<sup>3</sup>, making systems fragile and difficult to realize<sup>4-7</sup>. Due to their intrinsic topology<sup>8</sup>, Weyl semimetals are also potential candidates<sup>1,2</sup>, but have always been connected with bulk superconductivity, leaving the possibility of intrinsic superconductivity of their topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, practically without attention, even from the theory side. Here, by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we identify topological Fermi arcs on two opposing surfaces of the non-centrosymmetric Weyl material trigonal PtBi<sub>2</sub> (ref. <sup>9</sup>). We show these states become superconducting at temperatures around 10 K. Remarkably, the corresponding coherence peaks appear as the strongest and sharpest excitations ever detected by photoemission from solids. Our findings indicate that superconductivity in PtBi<sub>2</sub> can occur exclusively at the surface, rendering it a possible platform to host Majorana modes in intrinsically topological superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junctions.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06977-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Observation and quantification of the pseudogap in unitary Fermi gases.,"The microscopic origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains unknown. It is widely believed that substantial progress could be achieved by better understanding of the pseudogap phase, a normal non-superconducting state of cuprates<sup>1,2</sup>. In particular, a central issue is whether the pseudogap could originate from strong pairing fluctuations<sup>3</sup>. Unitary Fermi gases<sup>4,5</sup>, in which the pseudogap-if it exists-necessarily arises from many-body pairing, offer ideal quantum simulators to address this question. Here we report the observation of a pair-fluctuation-driven pseudogap in homogeneous unitary Fermi gases of lithium-6 atoms, by precisely measuring the fermion spectral function through momentum-resolved microwave spectroscopy and without spurious effects from final-state interactions. The temperature dependence of the pairing gap, inverse pair lifetime and single-particle scattering rate are quantitatively determined by analysing the spectra. We find a large pseudogap above the superfluid transition temperature. The inverse pair lifetime exhibits a thermally activated exponential behaviour, uncovering the microscopic virtual pair breaking and recombination mechanism. The obtained large, temperature-independent single-particle scattering rate is comparable with that set by the Planckian limit<sup>6</sup>. Our findings quantitatively characterize the pseudogap in strongly interacting Fermi gases and they lend support for the role of preformed pairing as a precursor to superfluidity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06964-y
Nature,2024-Feb,Recovery of isolated lithium through discharged state calendar ageing.,"Rechargeable Li-metal batteries have the potential to more than double the specific energy of the state-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion batteries, making Li-metal batteries a prime candidate for next-generation high-energy battery technology<sup>1-3</sup>. However, current Li-metal batteries suffer from fast cycle degradation compared with their Li-ion battery counterparts<sup>2,3</sup>, preventing their practical adoption. A main contributor to capacity degradation is the disconnection of Li from the electrochemical circuit, forming isolated Li<sup>4-8</sup>. Calendar ageing studies have shown that resting in the charged state promotes further reaction of active Li with the surrounding electrolyte<sup>9-12</sup>. Here we discover that calendar ageing in the discharged state improves capacity retention through isolated Li recovery, which is in contrast with the well-known phenomenon of capacity degradation observed during the charged state calendar ageing. Inactive capacity recovery is verified through observation of Coulombic efficiency greater than 100% on both Li||Cu half-cells and anode-free cells using a hybrid continuous-resting cycling protocol and with titration gas chromatography. An operando optical setup further confirms excess isolated Li reactivation as the predominant contributor to the increased capacity recovery. These insights into a previously unknown pathway for capacity recovery through discharged state resting emphasize the marked impact of cycling strategies on Li-metal battery performance.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06992-8
Nature,2024-Feb,A recently formed ocean inside Saturn's moon Mimas.,"Moons potentially harbouring a global ocean are tending to become relatively common objects in the Solar System<sup>1</sup>. The presence of these long-lived global oceans is generally betrayed by surface modification owing to internal dynamics<sup>2</sup>. Hence, Mimas would be the most unlikely place to look for the presence of a global ocean<sup>3</sup>. Here, from detailed analysis of Mimas's orbital motion based on Cassini data, with a particular focus on Mimas's periapsis drift, we show that its heavily cratered icy shell hides a global ocean, at a depth of 20-30 kilometres. Eccentricity damping implies that the ocean is likely to be less than 25 million years old and still evolving. Our simulations show that the ocean-ice interface reached a depth of less than 30 kilometres only recently (less than 2-3 million years ago), a time span too short for signs of activity at Mimas's surface to have appeared.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06975-9
Nature,2024-Feb,A rechargeable calcium-oxygen battery that operates at room temperature.,"Calcium-oxygen (Ca-O<sub>2</sub>) batteries can theoretically afford high capacity by the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to calcium oxide compounds (CaO<sub>x</sub>) at low cost<sup>1-5</sup>. Yet, a rechargeable Ca-O<sub>2</sub> battery that operates at room temperature has not been achieved because the CaO<sub>x</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> chemistry typically involves inert discharge products and few electrolytes can accommodate both a highly reductive Ca metal anode and O<sub>2</sub>. Here we report a Ca-O<sub>2</sub> battery that is rechargeable for 700 cycles at room temperature. Our battery relies on a highly reversible two-electron redox to form chemically reactive calcium peroxide (CaO<sub>2</sub>) as the discharge product. Using a durable ionic liquid-based electrolyte, this two-electron reaction is enabled by the facilitated Ca plating-stripping in the Ca metal anode at room temperature and improved CaO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> redox in the air cathode. We show the proposed Ca-O<sub>2</sub> battery is stable in air and can be made into flexible fibres that are weaved into textile batteries for next-generation wearable systems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06949-x
Nature,2024-Feb,A break in mitochondrial endosymbiosis as a basis for inflammatory diseases.,"Mitochondria retain bacterial traits due to their endosymbiotic origin, but host cells do not recognize them as foreign because the organelles are sequestered. However, the regulated release of mitochondrial factors into the cytosol can trigger cell death, innate immunity and inflammation. This selective breakdown in the 2-billion-year-old endosymbiotic relationship enables mitochondria to act as intracellular signalling hubs. Mitochondrial signals include proteins, nucleic acids, phospholipids, metabolites and reactive oxygen species, which have many modes of release from mitochondria, and of decoding in the cytosol and nucleus. Because these mitochondrial signals probably contribute to the homeostatic role of inflammation, dysregulation of these processes may lead to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. A potential reason for the increased incidence of these diseases may be changes in mitochondrial function and signalling in response to such recent phenomena as obesity, dietary changes and other environmental factors. Focusing on the mixed heritage of mitochondria therefore leads to predictions for future insights, research paths and therapeutic opportunities. Thus, whereas mitochondria can be considered 'the enemy within' the cell, evolution has used this strained relationship in intriguing ways, with increasing evidence pointing to the recent failure of endosymbiosis being critical for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06866-z
Nature,2024-Feb,Establishing reaction networks in the 16-electron sulfur reduction reaction.,"The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) plays a central role in high-capacity lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The SRR involves an intricate, 16-electron conversion process featuring multiple lithium polysulfide intermediates and reaction branches<sup>1-3</sup>. Establishing the complex reaction network is essential for rational tailoring of the SRR for improved Li-S batteries, but represents a daunting challenge<sup>4-6</sup>. Herein we systematically investigate the electrocatalytic SRR to decipher its network using the nitrogen, sulfur, dual-doped holey graphene framework as a model electrode to understand the role of electrocatalysts in acceleration of conversion kinetics. Combining cyclic voltammetry, in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we identify and directly profile the key intermediates (S<sub>8</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>S) at varying potentials and elucidate their conversion pathways. Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> were predominantly observed, in which Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> represents the key electrochemical intermediate dictating the overall SRR kinetics. Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>, generated (consumed) through a comproportionation (disproportionation) reaction, does not directly participate in electrochemical reactions but significantly contributes to the polysulfide shuttling process. We found that the nitrogen, sulfur dual-doped holey graphene framework catalyst could help accelerate polysulfide conversion kinetics, leading to faster depletion of soluble lithium polysulfides at higher potential and hence mitigating the polysulfide shuttling effect and boosting output potential. These results highlight the electrocatalytic approach as a promising strategy for tackling the fundamental challenges regarding Li-S batteries.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06918-4
Nature,2024-Feb,Flexible silicon solar cells with high power-to-weight ratios.,"Silicon solar cells are a mainstay of commercialized photovoltaics, and further improving the power conversion efficiency of large-area and flexible cells remains an important research objective<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we report a combined approach to improving the power conversion efficiency of silicon heterojunction solar cells, while at the same time rendering them flexible. We use low-damage continuous-plasma chemical vapour deposition to prevent epitaxy, self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth to develop doped contacts, and contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. High-performance cells of various thicknesses (55-130 μm) are fabricated, with certified efficiencies of 26.06% (57 μm), 26.19% (74 μm), 26.50% (84 μm), 26.56% (106 μm) and 26.81% (125 μm). The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight and cost, but also facilitates the charge migration and separation. It is found that the 57-μm flexible and thin solar cell shows the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9 W g<sup>-1</sup>) and open-circuit voltage (761 mV) compared to the thick ones. All of the solar cells characterized have an area of 274.4 cm<sup>2</sup>, and the cell components ensure reliability in potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation ageing tests. This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of flexible, lightweight, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06948-y
Nature,2024-Feb,"Stereodivergent 1,3-difunctionalization of alkenes by charge relocation.","Alkenes are indispensable feedstocks in chemistry. Functionalization at both carbons of the alkene-1,2-difunctionalization-is part of chemistry curricula worldwide<sup>1</sup>. Although difunctionalization at distal positions has been reported<sup>2-4</sup>, it typically relies on designer substrates featuring directing groups and/or stabilizing features, all of which determine the ultimate site of bond formation<sup>5-7</sup>. Here we introduce a method for the direct 1,3-difunctionalization of alkenes, based on a concept termed 'charge relocation', which enables stereodivergent access to 1,3-difunctionalized products of either syn- or anti-configuration from unactivated alkenes, without the need for directing groups or stabilizing features. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated in the synthesis of the pulmonary toxin 4-ipomeanol and its derivatives.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06938-0
Nature,2024-Feb,High-quality semiconductor fibres via mechanical design.,"Recent breakthroughs in fibre technology have enabled the assembly of functional materials with intimate interfaces into a single fibre with specific geometries<sup>1-11</sup>, delivering diverse functionalities over a large area, for example, serving as sensors, actuators, energy harvesting and storage, display, and healthcare apparatus<sup>12-17</sup>. As semiconductors are the critical component that governs device performance, the selection, control and engineering of semiconductors inside fibres are the key pathways to enabling high-performance functional fibres. However, owing to stress development and capillary instability in the high-yield fibre thermal drawing, both cracks and deformations in the semiconductor cores considerably affect the performance of these fibres. Here we report a mechanical design to achieve ultralong, fracture-free and perturbation-free semiconductor fibres, guided by a study on stress development and capillary instability at three stages of the fibre formation: the viscous flow, the core crystallization and the subsequent cooling stage. Then, the exposed semiconductor wires can be integrated into a single flexible fibre with well-defined interfaces with metal electrodes, thereby achieving optoelectronic fibres and large-scale optoelectronic fabrics. This work provides fundamental insights into extreme mechanics and fluid dynamics with geometries that are inaccessible in traditional platforms, essentially addressing the increasing demand for flexible and wearable optoelectronics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06946-0
Nature,2024-Feb,Durable CO<sub>2</sub> conversion in the proton-exchange membrane system.,"Electrolysis that reduces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to useful chemicals can, in principle, contribute to a more sustainable and carbon-neutral future<sup>1-6</sup>. However, it remains challenging to develop this into a robust process because efficient conversion typically requires alkaline conditions in which CO<sub>2</sub> precipitates as carbonate, and this limits carbon utilization and the stability of the system<sup>7-12</sup>. Strategies such as physical washing, pulsed operation and the use of dipolar membranes can partially alleviate these problems but do not fully resolve them<sup>11,13-15</sup>. CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis in acid electrolyte, where carbonate does not form, has therefore been explored as an ultimately more workable solution<sup>16-18</sup>. Herein we develop a proton-exchange membrane system that reduces CO<sub>2</sub> to formic acid at a catalyst that is derived from waste lead-acid batteries and in which a lattice carbon activation mechanism contributes. When coupling CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with hydrogen oxidation, formic acid is produced with over 93% Faradaic efficiency. The system is compatible with start-up/shut-down processes, achieves nearly 91% single-pass conversion efficiency for CO<sub>2</sub> at a current density of 600 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and cell voltage of 2.2 V and is shown to operate continuously for more than 5,200 h. We expect that this exceptional performance, enabled by the use of a robust and efficient catalyst, stable three-phase interface and durable membrane, will help advance the development of carbon-neutral technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06917-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Top-predator recovery abates geomorphic decline of a coastal ecosystem.,"The recovery of top predators is thought to have cascading effects on vegetated ecosystems and their geomorphology<sup>1,2</sup>, but the evidence for this remains correlational and intensely debated<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we combine observational and experimental data to reveal that recolonization of sea otters in a US estuary generates a trophic cascade that facilitates coastal wetland plant biomass and suppresses the erosion of marsh edges-a process that otherwise leads to the severe loss of habitats and ecosystem services<sup>5,6</sup>. Monitoring of the Elkhorn Slough estuary over several decades suggested top-down control in the system, because the erosion of salt marsh edges has generally slowed with increasing sea otter abundance, despite the consistently increasing physical stress in the system (that is, nutrient loading, sea-level rise and tidal scour<sup>7-9</sup>). Predator-exclusion experiments in five marsh creeks revealed that sea otters suppress the abundance of burrowing crabs, a top-down effect that cascades to both increase marsh edge strength and reduce marsh erosion. Multi-creek surveys comparing marsh creeks pre- and post-sea otter colonization confirmed the presence of an interaction between the keystone sea otter, burrowing crabs and marsh creeks, demonstrating the spatial generality of predator control of ecosystem edge processes: densities of burrowing crabs and edge erosion have declined markedly in creeks that have high levels of sea otter recolonization. These results show that trophic downgrading could be a strong but underappreciated contributor to the loss of coastal wetlands, and suggest that restoring top predators can help to re-establish geomorphic stability.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06959-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Designing a circular carbon and plastics economy for a sustainable future.,"The linear production and consumption of plastics today is unsustainable. It creates large amounts of unnecessary and mismanaged waste, pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, undermining global climate targets and the Sustainable Development Goals. This Perspective provides an integrated technological, economic and legal view on how to deliver a circular carbon and plastics economy that minimizes carbon dioxide emissions. Different pathways that maximize recirculation of carbon (dioxide) between plastics waste and feedstocks are outlined, including mechanical, chemical and biological recycling, and those involving the use of biomass and carbon dioxide. Four future scenarios are described, only one of which achieves sufficient greenhouse gas savings in line with global climate targets. Such a bold system change requires 50% reduction in future plastic demand, complete phase-out of fossil-derived plastics, 95% recycling rates of retrievable plastics and use of renewable energy. It is hard to overstate the challenge of achieving this goal. We therefore present a roadmap outlining the scale and timing of the economic and legal interventions that could possibly support this. Assessing the service lifespan and recoverability of plastic products, along with considerations of sufficiency and smart design, can moreover provide design principles to guide future manufacturing, use and disposal of plastics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06939-z
Nature,2024-Feb,7-Dehydrocholesterol dictates ferroptosis sensitivity.,"Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, has been implicated in multiple diseases, including cancer<sup>1-3</sup>, degenerative disorders<sup>4</sup> and organ ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)<sup>5,6</sup>. Here, using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified that the enzymes involved in distal cholesterol biosynthesis have pivotal yet opposing roles in regulating ferroptosis through dictating the level of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)-an intermediate metabolite of distal cholesterol biosynthesis that is synthesized by sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D) and metabolized by 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) for cholesterol synthesis. We found that the pathway components, including MSMO1, CYP51A1, EBP and SC5D, function as potential suppressors of ferroptosis, whereas DHCR7 functions as a pro-ferroptotic gene. Mechanistically, 7-DHC dictates ferroptosis surveillance by using the conjugated diene to exert its anti-phospholipid autoxidation function and shields plasma and mitochondria membranes from phospholipid autoxidation. Importantly, blocking the biosynthesis of endogenous 7-DHC by pharmacological targeting of EBP induces ferroptosis and inhibits tumour growth, whereas increasing the 7-DHC level by inhibiting DHCR7 effectively promotes cancer metastasis and attenuates the progression of kidney IRI, supporting a critical function of this axis in vivo. In conclusion, our data reveal a role of 7-DHC as a natural anti-ferroptotic metabolite and suggest that pharmacological manipulation of 7-DHC levels is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and IRI.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06983-9
Nature,2024-Feb,7-Dehydrocholesterol is an endogenous suppressor of ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that has received considerable attention not only as a means to eradicate defined tumour entities but also because it provides unforeseen insights into the metabolic adaptation that tumours exploit to counteract phospholipid oxidation<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, we identify proferroptotic activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) and an unexpected prosurvival function of its substrate, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Although previous studies suggested that high concentrations of 7-DHC are cytotoxic to developing neurons by favouring lipid peroxidation<sup>3</sup>, we now show that 7-DHC accumulation confers a robust prosurvival function in cancer cells. Because of its far superior reactivity towards peroxyl radicals, 7-DHC effectively shields (phospho)lipids from autoxidation and subsequent fragmentation. We provide validation in neuroblastoma and Burkitt's lymphoma xenografts where we demonstrate that the accumulation of 7-DHC is capable of inducing a shift towards a ferroptosis-resistant state in these tumours ultimately resulting in a more aggressive phenotype. Conclusively, our findings provide compelling evidence of a yet-unrecognized antiferroptotic activity of 7-DHC as a cell-intrinsic mechanism that could be exploited by cancer cells to escape ferroptosis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06878-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules.,"Ultracold polyatomic molecules offer opportunities<sup>1</sup> in cold chemistry<sup>2,3</sup>, precision measurements<sup>4</sup> and quantum information processing<sup>5,6</sup>, because of their rich internal structure. However, their increased complexity compared with diatomic molecules presents a challenge in using conventional cooling techniques. Here we demonstrate an approach to create weakly bound ultracold polyatomic molecules by electroassociation<sup>7</sup> (F.D. et al., manuscript in preparation) in a degenerate Fermi gas of microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance<sup>8-11</sup>. Starting from ground-state NaK molecules, we create around 1.1 × 10<sup>3</sup> weakly bound tetratomic (NaK)<sub>2</sub> molecules, with a phase space density of 0.040(3) at a temperature of 134(3) nK, more than 3,000 times colder than previously realized tetratomic molecules<sup>12</sup>. We observe a maximum tetramer lifetime of 8(2) ms in free space without a notable change in the presence of an optical dipole trap, indicating that these tetramers are collisionally stable. Moreover, we directly image the dissociated tetramers through microwave-field modulation to probe the anisotropy of their wavefunction in momentum space. Our result demonstrates a universal tool for assembling weakly bound ultracold polyatomic molecules from smaller polar molecules, which is a crucial step towards Bose-Einstein condensation of polyatomic molecules and towards a new crossover from a dipolar Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid<sup>13-15</sup> to a Bose-Einstein condensation of tetramers. Moreover, the long-lived field-linked state provides an ideal starting point for deterministic optical transfer to deeply bound tetramer states<sup>16-18</sup>.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06986-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Matrix viscoelasticity promotes liver cancer progression in the pre-cirrhotic liver.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics contribute to cancer development<sup>1,2</sup>, and increased stiffness is known to promote HCC progression in cirrhotic conditions<sup>3,4</sup>. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by an accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in the ECM; however, how this affects HCC in non-cirrhotic conditions is unclear. Here we find that, in patients and animal models, AGEs promote changes in collagen architecture and enhance ECM viscoelasticity, with greater viscous dissipation and faster stress relaxation, but not changes in stiffness. High AGEs and viscoelasticity combined with oncogenic β-catenin signalling promote HCC induction, whereas inhibiting AGE production, reconstituting the AGE clearance receptor AGER1 or breaking AGE-mediated collagen cross-links reduces viscoelasticity and HCC growth. Matrix analysis and computational modelling demonstrate that lower interconnectivity of AGE-bundled collagen matrix, marked by shorter fibre length and greater heterogeneity, enhances viscoelasticity. Mechanistically, animal studies and 3D cell cultures show that enhanced viscoelasticity promotes HCC cell proliferation and invasion through an integrin-β1-tensin-1-YAP mechanotransductive pathway. These results reveal that AGE-mediated structural changes enhance ECM viscoelasticity, and that viscoelasticity can promote cancer progression in vivo, independent of stiffness.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06991-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Single-photon superradiance in individual caesium lead halide quantum dots.,"The brightness of an emitter is ultimately described by Fermi's golden rule, with a radiative rate proportional to its oscillator strength times the local density of photonic states. As the oscillator strength is an intrinsic material property, the quest for ever brighter emission has relied on the local density of photonic states engineering, using dielectric or plasmonic resonators<sup>1,2</sup>. By contrast, a much less explored avenue is to boost the oscillator strength, and hence the emission rate, using a collective behaviour termed superradiance. Recently, it was proposed<sup>3</sup> that the latter can be realized using the giant oscillator-strength transitions of a weakly confined exciton in a quantum well when its coherent motion extends over many unit cells. Here we demonstrate single-photon superradiance in perovskite quantum dots with a sub-100 picosecond radiative decay time, almost as short as the reported exciton coherence time<sup>4</sup>. The characteristic dependence of radiative rates on the size, composition and temperature of the quantum dot suggests the formation of giant transition dipoles, as confirmed by effective-mass calculations. The results aid in the development of ultrabright, coherent quantum light sources and attest that quantum effects, for example, single-photon emission, persist in nanoparticles ten times larger than the exciton Bohr radius.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07001-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Fertilizer management for global ammonia emission reduction.,"Crop production is a large source of atmospheric ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), which poses risks to air quality, human health and ecosystems<sup>1-5</sup>. However, estimating global NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from croplands is subject to uncertainties because of data limitations, thereby limiting the accurate identification of mitigation options and efficacy<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we develop a machine learning model for generating crop-specific and spatially explicit NH<sub>3</sub> emission factors globally (5-arcmin resolution) based on a compiled dataset of field observations. We show that global NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from rice, wheat and maize fields in 2018 were 4.3 ± 1.0 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>, lower than previous estimates that did not fully consider fertilizer management practices<sup>6-9</sup>. Furthermore, spatially optimizing fertilizer management, as guided by the machine learning model, has the potential to reduce the NH<sub>3</sub> emissions by about 38% (1.6 ± 0.4 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>) without altering total fertilizer nitrogen inputs. Specifically, we estimate potential NH<sub>3</sub> emissions reductions of 47% (44-56%) for rice, 27% (24-28%) for maize and 26% (20-28%) for wheat cultivation, respectively. Under future climate change scenarios, we estimate that NH<sub>3</sub> emissions could increase by 4.0 ± 2.7% under SSP1-2.6 and 5.5 ± 5.7% under SSP5-8.5 by 2030-2060. However, targeted fertilizer management has the potential to mitigate these increases.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07020-z
Nature,2024-Feb,An epigenetic barrier sets the timing of human neuronal maturation.,"The pace of human brain development is highly protracted compared with most other species<sup>1-7</sup>. The maturation of cortical neurons is particularly slow, taking months to years to develop adult functions<sup>3-5</sup>. Remarkably, such protracted timing is retained in cortical neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) during in vitro differentiation or upon transplantation into the mouse brain<sup>4,8,9</sup>. Those findings suggest the presence of a cell-intrinsic clock setting the pace of neuronal maturation, although the molecular nature of this clock remains unknown. Here we identify an epigenetic developmental programme that sets the timing of human neuronal maturation. First, we developed a hPSC-based approach to synchronize the birth of cortical neurons in vitro which enabled us to define an atlas of morphological, functional and molecular maturation. We observed a slow unfolding of maturation programmes, limited by the retention of specific epigenetic factors. Loss of function of several of those factors in cortical neurons enables precocious maturation. Transient inhibition of EZH2, EHMT1 and EHMT2 or DOT1L, at progenitor stage primes newly born neurons to rapidly acquire mature properties upon differentiation. Thus our findings reveal that the rate at which human neurons mature is set well before neurogenesis through the establishment of an epigenetic barrier in progenitor cells. Mechanistically, this barrier holds transcriptional maturation programmes in a poised state that is gradually released to ensure the prolonged timeline of human cortical neuron maturation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06984-8
Nature,2024-Feb,The Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study enables generational genetic discoveries.,"Genomic research that targets large-scale, prospective birth cohorts constitutes an essential strategy for understanding the influence of genetics and environment on human health<sup>1</sup>. Nonetheless, such studies remain scarce, particularly in Asia. Here we present the phase I genome study of the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study<sup>2</sup> (BIGCS), which encompasses the sequencing and analysis of 4,053 Chinese individuals, primarily composed of trios or mother-infant duos residing in South China. Our analysis reveals novel genetic variants, a high-quality reference panel, and fine-scale local genetic structure within BIGCS. Notably, we identify previously unreported East Asian-specific genetic associations with maternal total bile acid, gestational weight gain and infant cord blood traits. Additionally, we observe prevalent age-specific genetic effects on lipid levels in mothers and infants. In an exploratory intergenerational Mendelian randomization analysis, we estimate the maternal putatively causal and fetal genetic effects of seven adult phenotypes on seven fetal growth-related measurements. These findings illuminate the genetic links between maternal and early-life traits in an East Asian population and lay the groundwork for future research into the intricate interplay of genetics, intrauterine exposures and early-life experiences in shaping long-term health.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06988-4
Nature,2024-Feb,Oxygen-evolving photosystem II structures during S<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>3</sub> transitions.,"Photosystem II (PSII) catalyses the oxidation of water through a four-step cycle of S<sub>i</sub> states (i = 0-4) at the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> cluster<sup>1-3</sup>, during which an extra oxygen (O6) is incorporated at the S<sub>3</sub> state to form a possible dioxygen<sup>4-7</sup>. Structural changes of the metal cluster and its environment during the S-state transitions have been studied on the microsecond timescale. Here we use pump-probe serial femtosecond crystallography to reveal the structural dynamics of PSII from nanoseconds to milliseconds after illumination with one flash (1F) or two flashes (2F). Y<sub>Z</sub>, a tyrosine residue that connects the reaction centre P680 and the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> cluster, showed structural changes on a nanosecond timescale, as did its surrounding amino acid residues and water molecules, reflecting the fast transfer of electrons and protons after flash illumination. Notably, one water molecule emerged in the vicinity of Glu189 of the D1 subunit of PSII (D1-E189), and was bound to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion on a sub-microsecond timescale after 2F illumination. This water molecule disappeared later with the concomitant increase of O6, suggesting that it is the origin of O6. We also observed concerted movements of water molecules in the O1, O4 and Cl-1 channels and their surrounding amino acid residues to complete the sequence of electron transfer, proton release and substrate water delivery. These results provide crucial insights into the structural dynamics of PSII during S-state transitions as well as O-O bond formation.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06987-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Stress response silencing by an E3 ligase mutated in neurodegeneration.,"Stress response pathways detect and alleviate adverse conditions to safeguard cell and tissue homeostasis, yet their prolonged activation induces apoptosis and disrupts organismal health<sup>1-3</sup>. How stress responses are turned off at the right time and place remains poorly understood. Here we report a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism that silences the cellular response to mitochondrial protein import stress. Crucial to this process is the silencing factor of the integrated stress response (SIFI), a large E3 ligase complex mutated in ataxia and in early-onset dementia that degrades both unimported mitochondrial precursors and stress response components. By recognizing bifunctional substrate motifs that equally encode protein localization and stability, the SIFI complex turns off a general stress response after a specific stress event has been resolved. Pharmacological stress response silencing sustains cell survival even if stress resolution failed, which underscores the importance of signal termination and provides a roadmap for treating neurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial import defects.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06985-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Single-neuronal elements of speech production in humans.,"Humans are capable of generating extraordinarily diverse articulatory movement combinations to produce meaningful speech. This ability to orchestrate specific phonetic sequences, and their syllabification and inflection over subsecond timescales allows us to produce thousands of word sounds and is a core component of language<sup>1,2</sup>. The fundamental cellular units and constructs by which we plan and produce words during speech, however, remain largely unknown. Here, using acute ultrahigh-density Neuropixels recordings capable of sampling across the cortical column in humans, we discover neurons in the language-dominant prefrontal cortex that encoded detailed information about the phonetic arrangement and composition of planned words during the production of natural speech. These neurons represented the specific order and structure of articulatory events before utterance and reflected the segmentation of phonetic sequences into distinct syllables. They also accurately predicted the phonetic, syllabic and morphological components of upcoming words and showed a temporally ordered dynamic. Collectively, we show how these mixtures of cells are broadly organized along the cortical column and how their activity patterns transition from articulation planning to production. We also demonstrate how these cells reliably track the detailed composition of consonant and vowel sounds during perception and how they distinguish processes specifically related to speaking from those related to listening. Together, these findings reveal a remarkably structured organization and encoding cascade of phonetic representations by prefrontal neurons in humans and demonstrate a cellular process that can support the production of speech.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06982-w
Nature,2024-Feb,SHR and SCR coordinate root patterning and growth early in the cell cycle.,"Precise control of cell division is essential for proper patterning and growth during the development of multicellular organisms. Coordination of formative divisions that generate new tissue patterns with proliferative divisions that promote growth is poorly understood. SHORTROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) are transcription factors that are required for formative divisions in the stem cell niche of Arabidopsis roots<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we show that levels of SHR and SCR early in the cell cycle determine the orientation of the division plane, resulting in either formative or proliferative cell division. We used 4D quantitative, long-term and frequent (every 15 min for up to 48 h) light sheet and confocal microscopy to probe the dynamics of SHR and SCR in tandem within single cells of living roots. Directly controlling their dynamics with an SHR induction system enabled us to challenge an existing bistable model<sup>3</sup> of the SHR-SCR gene-regulatory network and to identify key features that are essential for rescue of formative divisions in shr mutants. SHR and SCR kinetics do not align with the expected behaviour of a bistable system, and only low transient levels, present early in the cell cycle, are required for formative divisions. These results reveal an uncharacterized mechanism by which developmental regulators directly coordinate patterning and growth.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06971-z
Nature,2024-Feb,Conformational ensembles of the human intrinsically disordered proteome.,"Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (collectively, IDRs) are pervasive across proteomes in all kingdoms of life, help to shape biological functions and are involved in numerous diseases. IDRs populate a diverse set of transiently formed structures and defy conventional sequence-structure-function relationships<sup>1</sup>. Developments in protein science have made it possible to predict the three-dimensional structures of folded proteins at the proteome scale<sup>2</sup>. By contrast, there is a lack of knowledge about the conformational properties of IDRs, partly because the sequences of disordered proteins are poorly conserved and also because only a few of these proteins have been characterized experimentally. The inability to predict structural properties of IDRs across the proteome has limited our understanding of the functional roles of IDRs and how evolution shapes them. As a supplement to previous structural studies of individual IDRs<sup>3</sup>, we developed an efficient molecular model to generate conformational ensembles of IDRs and thereby to predict their conformational properties from sequences<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we use this model to simulate nearly all of the IDRs in the human proteome. Examining conformational ensembles of 28,058 IDRs, we show how chain compaction is correlated with cellular function and localization. We provide insights into how sequence features relate to chain compaction and, using a machine-learning model trained on our simulation data, show the conservation of conformational properties across orthologues. Our results recapitulate observations from previous studies of individual protein systems and exemplify how to link-at the proteome scale-conformational ensembles with cellular function and localization, amino acid sequence, evolutionary conservation and disease variants. Our freely available database of conformational properties will encourage further experimental investigation and enable the generation of hypotheses about the biological roles and evolution of IDRs.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07004-5
Nature,2024-Feb,"Homo sapiens reached the higher latitudes of Europe by 45,000 years ago.","The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Europe is associated with the regional disappearance of Neanderthals and the spread of Homo sapiens. Late Neanderthals persisted in western Europe several millennia after the occurrence of H. sapiens in eastern Europe<sup>1</sup>.

Here we present the morphological and proteomic taxonomic identification, mitochondrial DNA analysis and direct radiocarbon dating of human remains directly associated with an LRJ assemblage at the site Ilsenhöhle in Ranis (Germany). These human remains are among the earliest directly dated Upper Palaeolithic H. sapiens remains in Eurasia.

Nature,2024-Feb,HIV-1 capsids enter the FG phase of nuclear pores like a transport receptor.,"HIV-1 infection requires nuclear entry of the viral genome. Previous evidence suggests that this entry proceeds through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), with the 120 × 60 nm capsid squeezing through an approximately 60-nm-wide central channel<sup>1</sup> and crossing the permeability barrier of the NPC. This barrier can be described as an FG phase<sup>2</sup> that is assembled from cohesively interacting phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats<sup>3</sup> and is selectively permeable to cargo captured by nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). Here we show that HIV-1 capsid assemblies can target NPCs efficiently in an NTR-independent manner and bind directly to several types of FG repeats, including barrier-forming cohesive repeats. Like NTRs, the capsid readily partitions into an in vitro assembled cohesive FG phase that can serve as an NPC mimic and excludes much smaller inert probes such as mCherry. Indeed, entry of the capsid protein into such an FG phase is greatly enhanced by capsid assembly, which also allows the encapsulated clients to enter. Thus, our data indicate that the HIV-1 capsid behaves like an NTR, with its interior serving as a cargo container. Because capsid-coating with trans-acting NTRs would increase the diameter by 10 nm or more, we suggest that such a 'self-translocating' capsid undermines the size restrictions imposed by the NPC scaffold, thereby bypassing an otherwise effective barrier to viral infection.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06966-w
Nature,2024-Feb,The HIV capsid mimics karyopherin engagement of FG-nucleoporins.,"HIV can infect non-dividing cells because the viral capsid can overcome the selective barrier of the nuclear pore complex and deliver the genome directly into the nucleus<sup>1,2</sup>. Remarkably, the intact HIV capsid is more than 1,000 times larger than the size limit prescribed by the diffusion barrier of the nuclear pore<sup>3</sup>. This barrier in the central channel of the nuclear pore is composed of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains enriched in phenylalanine-glycine (FG) dipeptides. Through multivalent FG interactions, cellular karyopherins and their bound cargoes solubilize in this phase to drive nucleocytoplasmic transport<sup>4</sup>. By performing an in vitro dissection of the nuclear pore complex, we show that a pocket on the surface of the HIV capsid similarly interacts with FG motifs from multiple nucleoporins and that this interaction licences capsids to penetrate FG-nucleoporin condensates. This karyopherin mimicry model addresses a key conceptual challenge for the role of the HIV capsid in nuclear entry and offers an explanation as to how an exogenous entity much larger than any known cellular cargo may be able to non-destructively breach the nuclear envelope.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06969-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Transcription-replication interactions reveal bacterial genome regulation.,"Organisms determine the transcription rates of thousands of genes through a few modes of regulation that recur across the genome<sup>1</sup>. In bacteria, the relationship between the regulatory architecture of a gene and its expression is well understood for individual model gene circuits<sup>2,3</sup>. However, a broader perspective of these dynamics at the genome scale is lacking, in part because bacterial transcriptomics has hitherto captured only a static snapshot of expression averaged across millions of cells<sup>4</sup>. As a result, the full diversity of gene expression dynamics and their relation to regulatory architecture remains unknown. Here we present a novel genome-wide classification of regulatory modes based on the transcriptional response of each gene to its own replication, which we term the transcription-replication interaction profile (TRIP). Analysing single-bacterium RNA-sequencing data, we found that the response to the universal perturbation of chromosomal replication integrates biological regulatory factors with biophysical molecular events on the chromosome to reveal the local regulatory context of a gene. Whereas the TRIPs of many genes conform to a gene dosage-dependent pattern, others diverge in distinct ways, and this is shaped by factors such as intra-operon position and repression state. By revealing the underlying mechanistic drivers of gene expression heterogeneity, this work provides a quantitative, biophysical framework for modelling replication-dependent expression dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06974-w
Nature,2024-Feb,Coordination of cohesin and DNA replication observed with purified proteins.,"Two newly duplicated copies of genomic DNA are held together by the ring-shaped cohesin complex to ensure faithful inheritance of the genome during cell division<sup>1-3</sup>. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion by topologically entrapping two sister DNAs during DNA replication<sup>4,5</sup>, but how cohesion is established at the replication fork is poorly understood. Here, we studied the interplay between cohesin and replication by reconstituting a functional replisome using purified proteins. Once DNA is encircled before replication, the cohesin ring accommodates replication in its entirety, from initiation to termination, leading to topological capture of newly synthesized DNA. This suggests that topological cohesin loading is a critical molecular prerequisite to cope with replication. Paradoxically, topological loading per se is highly rate limiting and hardly occurs under the replication-competent physiological salt concentration. This inconsistency is resolved by the replisome-associated cohesion establishment factors Chl1 helicase and Ctf4 (refs. <sup>6,7</sup>), which promote cohesin loading specifically during continuing replication. Accordingly, we found that bubble DNA, which mimics the state of DNA unwinding, induces topological cohesin loading and this is further promoted by Chl1. Thus, we propose that cohesin converts the initial electrostatic DNA-binding mode to a topological embrace when it encounters unwound DNA structures driven by enzymatic activities including replication. Together, our results show how cohesin initially responds to replication, and provide a molecular model for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-07003-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Cortical regulation of helping behaviour towards others in pain.,"Humans and animals exhibit various forms of prosocial helping behaviour towards others in need<sup>1-3</sup>. Although previous research has investigated how individuals may perceive others' states<sup>4,5</sup>, the neural mechanisms of how they respond to others' needs and goals with helping behaviour remain largely unknown. Here we show that mice engage in a form of helping behaviour towards other individuals experiencing physical pain and injury-they exhibit allolicking (social licking) behaviour specifically towards the injury site, which aids the recipients in coping with pain. Using microendoscopic imaging, we found that single-neuron and ensemble activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes others' state of pain and that this representation is different from that of general stress in others. Furthermore, functional manipulations demonstrate a causal role of the ACC in bidirectionally controlling targeted allolicking. Notably, this behaviour is represented in a population code in the ACC that differs from that of general allogrooming, a distinct type of prosocial behaviour elicited by others' emotional stress. These findings advance our understanding of the neural coding and regulation of helping behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06973-x
Nature,2024-Feb,Motion of VAPB molecules reveals ER-mitochondria contact site subdomains.,"To coordinate cellular physiology, eukaryotic cells rely on the rapid exchange of molecules at specialized organelle-organelle contact sites<sup>1,2</sup>. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contact sites (ERMCSs) are particularly vital communication hubs, playing key roles in the exchange of signalling molecules, lipids and metabolites<sup>3,4</sup>. ERMCSs are maintained by interactions between complementary tethering molecules on the surface of each organelle<sup>5,6</sup>. However, due to the extreme sensitivity of these membrane interfaces to experimental perturbation<sup>7,8</sup>, a clear understanding of their nanoscale organization and regulation is still lacking. Here we combine three-dimensional electron microscopy with high-speed molecular tracking of a model organelle tether, Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein B (VAPB), to map the structure and diffusion landscape of ERMCSs. We uncovered dynamic subdomains within VAPB contact sites that correlate with ER membrane curvature and undergo rapid remodelling. We show that VAPB molecules enter and leave ERMCSs within seconds, despite the contact site itself remaining stable over much longer time scales. This metastability allows ERMCSs to remodel with changes in the physiological environment to accommodate metabolic needs of the cell. An amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated mutation in VAPB perturbs these subdomains, likely impairing their remodelling capacity and resulting in impaired interorganelle communication. These results establish high-speed single-molecule imaging as a new tool for mapping the structure of contact site interfaces and reveal that the diffusion landscape of VAPB at contact sites is a crucial component of ERMCS homeostasis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06956-y
Nature,2024-Feb,A dedicated hypothalamic oxytocin circuit controls aversive social learning.,"To survive in a complex social group, one needs to know who to approach and, more importantly, who to avoid. In mice, a single defeat causes the losing mouse to stay away from the winner for weeks<sup>1</sup>. Here through a series of functional manipulation and recording experiments, we identify oxytocin neurons in the retrochiasmatic supraoptic nucleus (SOR<sup>OXT</sup>) and oxytocin-receptor-expressing cells in the anterior subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral part (aVMHvl<sup>OXTR</sup>) as a key circuit motif for defeat-induced social avoidance. Before defeat, aVMHvl<sup>OXTR</sup> cells minimally respond to aggressor cues. During defeat, aVMHvl<sup>OXTR</sup> cells are highly activated and, with the help of an exclusive oxytocin supply from the SOR, potentiate their responses to aggressor cues. After defeat, strong aggressor-induced aVMHvl<sup>OXTR</sup> cell activation drives the animal to avoid the aggressor and minimizes future defeat. Our study uncovers a neural process that supports rapid social learning caused by defeat and highlights the importance of the brain oxytocin system in social plasticity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06958-w
Nature,2024-Feb,Predator mass mortality events restructure food webs through trophic decoupling.,"Predators have a key role in structuring ecosystems<sup>1-4</sup>. However, predator loss is accelerating globally<sup>4-6</sup>, and predator mass-mortality events<sup>7</sup> (MMEs)-rapid large-scale die-offs-are now emblematic of the Anthropocene epoch<sup>6</sup>. Owing to their rare and unpredictable nature<sup>7</sup>, we lack an understanding of how MMEs immediately impact ecosystems. Past predator-removal studies<sup>2,3</sup> may be insufficient to understand the ecological consequences of MMEs because, in nature, dead predators decompose in situ and generate a resource pulse<sup>8</sup>, which could alter ensuing ecosystem dynamics by temporarily enhancing productivity. Here we experimentally induce MMEs in tritrophic, freshwater lake food webs and report ecological dynamics that are distinct from predator losses<sup>2,3</sup> or resource pulses<sup>9</sup> alone, but that can be predicted from theory<sup>8</sup>. MMEs led to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer communities resulting from weakened top-down predator control<sup>1-3</sup> and stronger bottom-up effects through predator decomposition<sup>8</sup>. In contrast to predator removals alone, enhanced primary production after MMEs dampened the consumer community response. As a consequence, MMEs generated biomass dynamics that were most similar to those of undisturbed systems, indicating that they may be cryptic disturbances in nature. These biomass dynamics led to trophic decoupling, whereby the indirect beneficial effects of predators on primary producers are lost and later materialize as direct bottom-up effects that stimulate primary production amid intensified herbivory. These results reveal ecological signatures of MMEs and demonstrate the feasibility of forecasting novel ecological dynamics arising with intensifying global change.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06931-7
Nature,2024-Feb,Affinity-optimizing enhancer variants disrupt development.,"Enhancers control the location and timing of gene expression and contain the majority of variants associated with disease<sup>1-3</sup>. The ZRS is arguably the most well-studied vertebrate enhancer and mediates the expression of Shh in the developing limb<sup>4</sup>. Thirty-one human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the ZRS are associated with polydactyly<sup>4-6</sup>. However, how this enhancer encodes tissue-specific activity, and the mechanisms by which SNVs alter the number of digits, are poorly understood. Here we show that the ETS sites within the ZRS are low affinity, and identify a functional ETS site, ETS-A, with extremely low affinity. Two human SNVs and a synthetic variant optimize the binding affinity of ETS-A subtly from 15% to around 25% relative to the strongest ETS binding sequence, and cause polydactyly with the same penetrance and severity. A greater increase in affinity results in phenotypes that are more penetrant and more severe. Affinity-optimizing SNVs in other ETS sites in the ZRS, as well as in ETS, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), HOX and activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites within a wide variety of enhancers, cause gain-of-function gene expression. The prevalence of binding sites with suboptimal affinity in enhancers creates a vulnerability in genomes whereby SNVs that optimize affinity, even slightly, can be pathogenic. Searching for affinity-optimizing SNVs in genomes could provide a mechanistic approach to identify causal variants that underlie enhanceropathies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06922-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Autoreactive T cells target peripheral nerves in Guillain-Barré syndrome.,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare heterogenous disorder of the peripheral nervous system, which is usually triggered by a preceding infection, and causes a potentially life-threatening progressive muscle weakness<sup>1</sup>. Although GBS is considered an autoimmune disease, the mechanisms that underlie its distinct clinical subtypes remain largely unknown. Here, by combining in vitro T cell screening, single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we identify autoreactive memory CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, that show a cytotoxic T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1)-like phenotype, and rare CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that target myelin antigens of the peripheral nerves in patients with the demyelinating disease variant. We characterized more than 1,000 autoreactive single T cell clones, which revealed a polyclonal TCR repertoire, short CDR3β lengths, preferential HLA-DR restrictions and recognition of immunodominant epitopes. We found that autoreactive TCRβ clonotypes were expanded in the blood of the same patient at distinct disease stages and, notably, that they were shared in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid across different patients with GBS, but not in control individuals. Finally, we identified myelin-reactive T cells in the nerve biopsy from one patient, which indicates that these cells contribute directly to disease pathophysiology. Collectively, our data provide clear evidence of autoreactive T cell immunity in a subset of patients with GBS, and open new perspectives in the field of inflammatory peripheral neuropathies, with potential impact for biomedical applications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06916-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Alternative splicing of latrophilin-3 controls synapse formation.,"The assembly and specification of synapses in the brain is incompletely understood<sup>1-3</sup>. Latrophilin-3 (encoded by Adgrl3, also known as Lphn3)-a postsynaptic adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor-mediates synapse formation in the hippocampus<sup>4</sup> but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we show in mice that LPHN3 organizes synapses through a convergent dual-pathway mechanism: activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> signalling and recruitment of phase-separated postsynaptic protein scaffolds. We found that cell-type-specific alternative splicing of Lphn3 controls the LPHN3 G-protein-coupling mode, resulting in LPHN3 variants that predominantly signal through Gα<sub>s</sub> or Gα<sub>12/13</sub>. CRISPR-mediated manipulation of Lphn3 alternative splicing that shifts LPHN3 from a Gα<sub>s</sub>- to a Gα<sub>12/13</sub>-coupled mode impaired synaptic connectivity as severely as the overall deletion of Lphn3, suggesting that Gα<sub>s</sub> signalling by LPHN3 splice variants mediates synapse formation. Notably, Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled, but not Gα<sub>12/13</sub>-coupled, splice variants of LPHN3 also recruit phase-transitioned postsynaptic protein scaffold condensates, such that these condensates are clustered by binding of presynaptic teneurin and FLRT ligands to LPHN3. Moreover, neuronal activity promotes alternative splicing of the synaptogenic Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled variant of LPHN3. Together, these data suggest that activity-dependent alternative splicing of a key synaptic adhesion molecule controls synapse formation by parallel activation of two convergent pathways: Gα<sub>s</sub> signalling and clustered phase separation of postsynaptic protein scaffolds.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06913-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Observation of interband Berry phase in laser-driven crystals.,"Ever since its discovery<sup>1</sup>, the notion of the Berry phase has permeated all branches of physics and plays an important part in a variety of quantum phenomena<sup>2</sup>. However, so far all its realizations have been based on a continuous evolution of the quantum state, following a cyclic path. Here we introduce and demonstrate a conceptually new manifestation of the Berry phase in light-driven crystals, in which the electronic wavefunction accumulates a geometric phase during a discrete evolution between different bands, while preserving the coherence of the process. We experimentally reveal this phase by using a strong laser field to engineer an internal interferometer, induced during less than one cycle of the driving field, which maps the phase onto the emission of higher-order harmonics. Our work provides an opportunity for the study of geometric phases, leading to a variety of observations in light-driven topological phenomena and attosecond solid-state physics.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06828-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Sulfur dioxide in the mid-infrared transmission spectrum of WASP-39b.,"The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere of the hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations<sup>1-3</sup> suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres<sup>4</sup>. This is because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance of SO<sub>2</sub> under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>S (1-10 ppm)<sup>4-9</sup>. However, the SO<sub>2</sub> inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 μm and, therefore, the detection of other SO<sub>2</sub> absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO<sub>2</sub> abundance. Here we report the detection of SO<sub>2</sub> spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5 μm in the 5-12-μm transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)<sup>10</sup>. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO<sub>2</sub> of 0.5-25 ppm (1σ range), consistent with previous findings<sup>4</sup>. As well as SO<sub>2</sub>, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 μm. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1-8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07040-9
Nature,2024-Feb,A lethal mitonuclear incompatibility in complex I of natural hybrids.,"The evolution of reproductive barriers is the first step in the formation of new species and can help us understand the diversification of life on Earth. These reproductive barriers often take the form of hybrid incompatibilities, in which alleles derived from two different species no longer interact properly in hybrids<sup>1-3</sup>. Theory predicts that hybrid incompatibilities may be more likely to arise at rapidly evolving genes<sup>4-6</sup> and that incompatibilities involving multiple genes should be common<sup>7,8</sup>, but there has been sparse empirical data to evaluate these predictions. Here we describe a mitonuclear incompatibility involving three genes whose protein products are in physical contact within respiratory complex I of naturally hybridizing swordtail fish species. Individuals homozygous for mismatched protein combinations do not complete embryonic development or die as juveniles, whereas those heterozygous for the incompatibility have reduced complex I function and unbalanced representation of parental alleles in the mitochondrial proteome. We find that the effects of different genetic interactions on survival are non-additive, highlighting subtle complexity in the genetic architecture of hybrid incompatibilities. Finally, we document the evolutionary history of the genes involved, showing signals of accelerated evolution and evidence that an incompatibility has been transferred between species via hybridization.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06895-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Structural transition and migration of incoherent twin boundary in diamond.,"Grain boundaries (GBs), with their diversity in both structure and structural transitions, play an essential role in tailoring the properties of polycrystalline materials<sup>1-5</sup>. As a unique GB subset, {112} incoherent twin boundaries (ITBs) are ubiquitous in nanotwinned, face-centred cubic materials<sup>6-9</sup>. Although multiple ITB configurations and transitions have been reported<sup>7,10</sup>, their transition mechanisms and impacts on mechanical properties remain largely unexplored, especially in regard to covalent materials. Here we report atomic observations of six ITB configurations and structural transitions in diamond at room temperature, showing a dislocation-mediated mechanism different from metallic systems<sup>11,12</sup>. The dominant ITBs are asymmetric and less mobile, contributing strongly to continuous hardening in nanotwinned diamond<sup>13</sup>. The potential driving forces of ITB activities are discussed. Our findings shed new light on GB behaviour in diamond and covalent materials, pointing to a new strategy for development of high-performance, nanotwinned materials.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06908-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Discovery of a structural class of antibiotics with explainable deep learning.,"The discovery of novel structural classes of antibiotics is urgently needed to address the ongoing antibiotic resistance crisis<sup>1-9</sup>. Deep learning approaches have aided in exploring chemical spaces<sup>1,10-15</sup>; these typically use black box models and do not provide chemical insights. Here we reasoned that the chemical substructures associated with antibiotic activity learned by neural network models can be identified and used to predict structural classes of antibiotics. We tested this hypothesis by developing an explainable, substructure-based approach for the efficient, deep learning-guided exploration of chemical spaces. We determined the antibiotic activities and human cell cytotoxicity profiles of 39,312 compounds and applied ensembles of graph neural networks to predict antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity for 12,076,365 compounds. Using explainable graph algorithms, we identified substructure-based rationales for compounds with high predicted antibiotic activity and low predicted cytotoxicity. We empirically tested 283 compounds and found that compounds exhibiting antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus were enriched in putative structural classes arising from rationales. Of these structural classes of compounds, one is selective against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, evades substantial resistance, and reduces bacterial titres in mouse models of MRSA skin and systemic thigh infection. Our approach enables the deep learning-guided discovery of structural classes of antibiotics and demonstrates that machine learning models in drug discovery can be explainable, providing insights into the chemical substructures that underlie selective antibiotic activity.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06887-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Protracted neuronal recruitment in the temporal lobes of young children.,"The temporal lobe of the human brain contains the entorhinal cortex (EC). This region of the brain is a highly interconnected integrative hub for sensory and spatial information; it also has a key role in episodic memory formation and is the main source of cortical hippocampal inputs<sup>1-4</sup>. The human EC continues to develop during childhood<sup>5</sup>, but neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered to be complete by birth. Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions, with a large tangential stream persisting until the age of around one year and radial dispersal continuing until around two to three years of age. By contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ganglionic eminence germinal zones, the EC stream and the postnatal EC revealed that most migrating cells in the EC stream are derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence and become LAMP5<sup>+</sup>RELN<sup>+</sup> inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life, when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, and previous work has linked cognitive decline to the loss of LAMP5<sup>+</sup>RELN<sup>+</sup> cells<sup>6,7</sup>. Our investigation reveals that many of these cells arrive in the EC through a major postnatal migratory stream in early childhood.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06981-x
Nature,2024-Feb,Global population profile of tropical cyclone exposure from 2002 to 2019.,"Tropical cyclones have far-reaching impacts on livelihoods and population health that often persist years after the event<sup>1-4</sup>. Characterizing the demographic and socioeconomic profile and the vulnerabilities of exposed populations is essential to assess health and other risks associated with future tropical cyclone events<sup>5</sup>. Estimates of exposure to tropical cyclones are often regional rather than global<sup>6</sup> and do not consider population vulnerabilities<sup>7</sup>. Here we combine spatially resolved annual demographic estimates with tropical cyclone wind fields estimates to construct a global profile of the populations exposed to tropical cyclones between 2002 and 2019. We find that approximately 560 million people are exposed yearly and that the number of people exposed has increased across all cyclone intensities over the study period. The age distribution of those exposed has shifted away from children (less than 5 years old) and towards older people (more than 60 years old) in recent years compared with the early 2000s. Populations exposed to tropical cyclones are more socioeconomically deprived than those unexposed within the same country, and this relationship is more pronounced for people exposed to higher-intensity storms. By characterizing the patterns and vulnerabilities of exposed populations, our results can help identify mitigation strategies and assess the global burden and future risks of tropical cyclones.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06963-z
Nature,2024-Feb,Stable blue phosphorescent organic LEDs that use polariton-enhanced Purcell effects.,"Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) feature high efficiency<sup>1,2</sup>, brightness and colour tunability suitable for both display and lighting applications<sup>3</sup>. However, overcoming the short operational lifetime of blue PHOLEDs remains one of the most challenging high-value problems in the field of organic electronics. Their short lifetimes originate from the annihilation of high-energy, long-lived blue triplets that leads to molecular dissociation<sup>4-7</sup>. The Purcell effect, the enhancement of the radiative decay rate in a microcavity, can reduce the triplet density and, hence, the probability of destructive high-energy triplet-polaron annihilation (TPA)<sup>5,6</sup> and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) events<sup>4,5,7,8</sup>. Here we introduce the polariton-enhanced Purcell effect in blue PHOLEDs. We find that plasmon-exciton polaritons<sup>9</sup> (PEPs) substantially increase the strength of the Purcell effect and achieve an average Purcell factor (PF) of 2.4 ± 0.2 over a 50-nm-thick emission layer (EML) in a blue PHOLED. A 5.3-fold improvement in LT90 (the time for the PHOLED luminance to decay to 90% of its initial value) of a cyan-emitting Ir-complex device is achieved compared with its use in a conventional PHOLED. Shifting the chromaticity coordinates to (0.14, 0.14) and (0.15, 0.20) into the deep blue, the Purcell-enhanced devices achieve 10-14 times improvement over similarly deep-blue PHOLEDs, with one structure reaching the longest Ir-complex device lifetime of LT90 = 140 ± 20 h reported so far<sup>10-21</sup>. The polariton-enhanced Purcell effect and microcavity engineering provide new possibilities for extending deep-blue PHOLED lifetimes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06976-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Digital measurement of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from 7 million contacts.,"How likely is it to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 after being exposed? Almost everyone wondered about this question during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact-tracing apps<sup>1,2</sup> recorded measurements of proximity<sup>3</sup> and duration between nearby smartphones. Contacts-individuals exposed to confirmed cases-were notified according to public health policies such as the 2 m, 15 min guideline<sup>4,5</sup>, despite limited evidence supporting this threshold. Here we analysed 7 million contacts notified by the National Health Service COVID-19 app<sup>6,7</sup> in England and Wales to infer how app measurements translated to actual transmissions. Empirical metrics and statistical modelling showed a strong relation between app-computed risk scores and actual transmission probability. Longer exposures at greater distances had risk similar to that of shorter exposures at closer distances. The probability of transmission confirmed by a reported positive test increased initially linearly with duration of exposure (1.1% per hour) and continued increasing over several days. Whereas most exposures were short (median 0.7 h, interquartile range 0.4-1.6), transmissions typically resulted from exposures lasting between 1 h and several days (median 6 h, interquartile range 1.4-28). Households accounted for about 6% of contacts but 40% of transmissions. With sufficient preparation, privacy-preserving yet precise analyses of risk that would inform public health measures, based on digital contact tracing, could be performed within weeks of the emergence of a new pathogen.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06952-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Designer phospholipid capping ligands for soft metal halide nanocrystals.,"The success of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) in science and optoelectronics is inextricable from their surfaces. The functionalization of lead halide perovskite NCs<sup>1-5</sup> poses a formidable challenge because of their structural lability, unlike the well-established covalent ligand capping of conventional semiconductor NCs<sup>6,7</sup>. We posited that the vast and facile molecular engineering of phospholipids as zwitterionic surfactants can deliver highly customized surface chemistries for metal halide NCs. Molecular dynamics simulations implied that ligand-NC surface affinity is primarily governed by the structure of the zwitterionic head group, particularly by the geometric fitness of the anionic and cationic moieties into the surface lattice sites, as corroborated by the nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy data. Lattice-matched primary-ammonium phospholipids enhance the structural and colloidal integrity of hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites (FAPbBr<sub>3</sub> and MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> (FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium)) and lead-free metal halide NCs. The molecular structure of the organic ligand tail governs the long-term colloidal stability and compatibility with solvents of diverse polarity, from hydrocarbons to acetone and alcohols. These NCs exhibit photoluminescence quantum yield of more than 96% in solution and solids and minimal photoluminescence intermittency at the single particle level with an average ON fraction as high as 94%, as well as bright and high-purity (about 95%) single-photon emission.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06932-6
Nature,2024-Feb,Country-specific net-zero strategies of the pulp and paper industry.,"The pulp and paper industry is an important contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions<sup>1,2</sup>. Country-specific strategies are essential for the industry to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, given its vast heterogeneities across countries<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we develop a comprehensive bottom-up assessment of net greenhouse gas emissions of the domestic paper-related sectors for 30 major countries from 1961 to 2019-about 3.2% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from the same period<sup>5</sup>-and explore mitigation strategies through 2,160 scenarios covering key factors. Our results show substantial differences across countries in terms of historical emissions evolution trends and structure. All countries can achieve net-zero emissions for their pulp and paper industry by 2050, with a single measure for most developed countries and several measures for most developing countries. Except for energy-efficiency improvement and energy-system decarbonization, tropical developing countries with abundant forest resources should give priority to sustainable forest management, whereas other developing countries should pay more attention to enhancing methane capture rate and reducing recycling. These insights are crucial for developing net-zero strategies tailored to each country and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 for the pulp and paper industry.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06962-0
Nature,2024-Feb,Functional and evolutionary significance of unknown genes from uncultivated taxa.,"Many of the Earth's microbes remain uncultured and understudied, limiting our understanding of the functional and evolutionary aspects of their genetic material, which remain largely overlooked in most metagenomic studies<sup>1</sup>. Here we analysed 149,842 environmental genomes from multiple habitats<sup>2-6</sup> and compiled a curated catalogue of 404,085 functionally and evolutionarily significant novel (FESNov) gene families exclusive to uncultivated prokaryotic taxa. All FESNov families span multiple species, exhibit strong signals of purifying selection and qualify as new orthologous groups, thus nearly tripling the number of bacterial and archaeal gene families described to date. The FESNov catalogue is enriched in clade-specific traits, including 1,034 novel families that can distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes and orders, probably representing synapomorphies that facilitated their evolutionary divergence. Using genomic context analysis and structural alignments we predicted functional associations for 32.4% of FESNov families, including 4,349 high-confidence associations with important biological processes. These predictions provide a valuable hypothesis-driven framework that we used for experimental validatation of a new gene family involved in cell motility and a novel set of antimicrobial peptides. We also demonstrate that the relative abundance profiles of novel families can discriminate between environments and clinical conditions, leading to the discovery of potentially new biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer. We expect this work to enhance future metagenomics studies and expand our knowledge of the genetic repertory of uncultivated organisms.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06955-z
Nature,2024-Feb,The energetic and allosteric landscape for KRAS inhibition.,"Thousands of proteins have been validated genetically as therapeutic targets for human diseases<sup>1</sup>. However, very few have been successfully targeted, and many are considered 'undruggable'. This is particularly true for proteins that function via protein-protein interactions-direct inhibition of binding interfaces is difficult and requires the identification of allosteric sites. However, most proteins have no known allosteric sites, and a comprehensive allosteric map does not exist for any protein. Here we address this shortcoming by charting multiple global atlases of inhibitory allosteric communication in KRAS. We quantified the effects of more than 26,000 mutations on the folding of KRAS and its binding to six interaction partners. Genetic interactions in double mutants enabled us to perform biophysical measurements at scale, inferring more than 22,000 causal free energy changes. These energy landscapes quantify how mutations tune the binding specificity of a signalling protein and map the inhibitory allosteric sites for an important therapeutic target. Allosteric propagation is particularly effective across the central β-sheet of KRAS, and multiple surface pockets are genetically validated as allosterically active, including a distal pocket in the C-terminal lobe of the protein. Allosteric mutations typically inhibit binding to all tested effectors, but they can also change the binding specificity, revealing the regulatory, evolutionary and therapeutic potential to tune pathway activation. Using the approach described here, it should be possible to rapidly and comprehensively identify allosteric target sites in many proteins.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06954-0

De novo protein design can now generate binders with high affinity and specificity to structured proteins<sup>6,7</sup>. However, the design of interactions between proteins and short peptides with helical propensity is an unmet challenge. Here we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that by extending RFdiffusion<sup>8</sup> to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors. The ability to design binders to conformationally variable targets, and to optimize by partial diffusion both natural and designed proteins, should be broadly useful.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06953-1
Nature,2024-Feb,Mucosal boosting enhances vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaques.,"A limitation of current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is that they provide minimal protection against infection with current Omicron subvariants<sup>1,2</sup>, although they still provide protection against severe disease. Enhanced mucosal immunity may be required to block infection and onward transmission. Intranasal administration of current vaccines has proven inconsistent<sup>3-7</sup>, suggesting that alternative immunization strategies may be required. Here we show that intratracheal boosting with a bivalent Ad26-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine results in substantial induction of mucosal humoral and cellular immunity and near-complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 BQ.1.1 challenge. A total of 40 previously immunized rhesus macaques were boosted with a bivalent Ad26 vaccine by the intramuscular, intranasal and intratracheal routes, or with a bivalent mRNA vaccine by the intranasal route. Ad26 boosting by the intratracheal route led to a substantial expansion of mucosal neutralizing antibodies, IgG and IgA binding antibodies, and CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, which exceeded those induced by Ad26 boosting by the intramuscular and intranasal routes. Intratracheal Ad26 boosting also led to robust upregulation of cytokine, natural killer, and T and B cell pathways in the lungs. After challenge with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 BQ.1.1, intratracheal Ad26 boosting provided near-complete protection, whereas the other boosting strategies proved less effective. Protective efficacy correlated best with mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses. These data demonstrate that these immunization strategies induce robust mucosal immunity, suggesting the feasibility of developing vaccines that block respiratory viral infections.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06951-3
Nature,2024-Feb,"Structures, functions and adaptations of the human LINE-1 ORF2 protein.","The LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon is an ancient genetic parasite that has written around one-third of the human genome through a 'copy and paste' mechanism catalysed by its multifunctional enzyme, open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p)<sup>1</sup>. ORF2p reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease activities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer<sup>2,3</sup>, autoimmunity<sup>4,5</sup> and ageing<sup>6,7</sup>, making ORF2p a potential therapeutic target. However, a lack of structural and mechanistic knowledge has hampered efforts to rationally exploit it. We report structures of the human ORF2p 'core' (residues 238-1061, including the RT domain) by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy in several conformational states. Our analyses identified two previously undescribed folded domains, extensive contacts to RNA templates and associated adaptations that contribute to unique aspects of the L1 replication cycle. Computed integrative structural models of full-length ORF2p show a dynamic closed-ring conformation that appears to open during retrotransposition. We characterize ORF2p RT inhibition and reveal its underlying structural basis. Imaging and biochemistry show that non-canonical cytosolic ORF2p RT activity can produce RNA:DNA hybrids, activating innate immune signalling through cGAS/STING and resulting in interferon production<sup>6-8</sup>. In contrast to retroviral RTs, L1 RT is efficiently primed by short RNAs and hairpins, which probably explains cytosolic priming. Other biochemical activities including processivity, DNA-directed polymerization, non-templated base addition and template switching together allow us to propose a revised L1 insertion model. Finally, our evolutionary analysis demonstrates structural conservation between ORF2p and other RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerases. We therefore provide key mechanistic insights into L1 polymerization and insertion, shed light on the evolutionary history of L1 and enable rational drug development targeting L1.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06947-z
Nature,2024-Feb,Template and target-site recognition by human LINE-1 in retrotransposition.,"The long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, hereafter L1) retrotransposon has generated nearly one-third of the human genome and serves as an active source of genetic diversity and human disease<sup>1</sup>. L1 spreads through a mechanism termed target-primed reverse transcription, in which the encoded enzyme (ORF2p) nicks the target DNA to prime reverse transcription of its own or non-self RNAs<sup>2</sup>. Here we purified full-length L1 ORF2p and biochemically reconstituted robust target-primed reverse transcription with template RNA and target-site DNA. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the complete human L1 ORF2p bound to structured template RNAs and initiating cDNA synthesis. The template polyadenosine tract is recognized in a sequence-specific manner by five distinct domains. Among them, an RNA-binding domain bends the template backbone to allow engagement of an RNA hairpin stem with the L1 ORF2p C-terminal segment. Moreover, structure and biochemical reconstitutions demonstrate an unexpected target-site requirement: L1 ORF2p relies on upstream single-stranded DNA to position the adjacent duplex in the endonuclease active site for nicking of the longer DNA strand, with a single nick generating a staggered DNA break. Our research provides insights into the mechanism of ongoing transposition in the human genome and informs the engineering of retrotransposon proteins for gene therapy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06933-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Large-scale single-neuron speech sound encoding across the depth of human cortex.,"Understanding the neural basis of speech perception requires that we study the human brain both at the scale of the fundamental computational unit of neurons and in their organization across the depth of cortex. Here we used high-density Neuropixels arrays<sup>1-3</sup> to record from 685 neurons across cortical layers at nine sites in a high-level auditory region that is critical for speech, the superior temporal gyrus<sup>4,5</sup>, while participants listened to spoken sentences. Single neurons encoded a wide range of speech sound cues, including features of consonants and vowels, relative vocal pitch, onsets, amplitude envelope and sequence statistics. Neurons at each cross-laminar recording exhibited dominant tuning to a primary speech feature while also containing a substantial proportion of neurons that encoded other features contributing to heterogeneous selectivity. Spatially, neurons at similar cortical depths tended to encode similar speech features. Activity across all cortical layers was predictive of high-frequency field potentials (electrocorticography), providing a neuronal origin for macroelectrode recordings from the cortical surface. Together, these results establish single-neuron tuning across the cortical laminae as an important dimension of speech encoding in human superior temporal gyrus.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06839-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Modelling post-implantation human development to yolk sac blood emergence.,"Implantation of the human embryo begins a critical developmental stage that comprises profound events including axis formation, gastrulation and the emergence of haematopoietic system<sup>1,2</sup>. Our mechanistic knowledge of this window of human life remains limited due to restricted access to in vivo samples for both technical and ethical reasons<sup>3-5</sup>. Stem cell models of human embryo have emerged to help unlock the mysteries of this stage<sup>6-16</sup>. Here we present a genetically inducible stem cell-derived embryoid model of early post-implantation human embryogenesis that captures the reciprocal codevelopment of embryonic tissue and the extra-embryonic endoderm and mesoderm niche with early haematopoiesis. This model is produced from induced pluripotent stem cells and shows unanticipated self-organizing cellular programmes similar to those that occur in embryogenesis, including the formation of amniotic cavity and bilaminar disc morphologies as well as the generation of an anterior hypoblast pole and posterior domain. The extra-embryonic layer in these embryoids lacks trophoblast and shows advanced multilineage yolk sac tissue-like morphogenesis that harbours a process similar to distinct waves of haematopoiesis, including the emergence of erythroid-, megakaryocyte-, myeloid- and lymphoid-like cells. This model presents an easy-to-use, high-throughput, reproducible and scalable platform to probe multifaceted aspects of human development and blood formation at the early post-implantation stage. It will provide a tractable human-based model for drug testing and disease modelling.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06914-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Dynamic behaviour restructuring mediates dopamine-dependent credit assignment.,"Animals exhibit a diverse behavioural repertoire when exploring new environments and can learn which actions or action sequences produce positive outcomes. Dopamine release after encountering a reward is critical for reinforcing reward-producing actions<sup>1-3</sup>. However, it has been challenging to understand how credit is assigned to the exact action that produced the dopamine release during continuous behaviour. Here we investigated this problem in mice using a self-stimulation paradigm in which specific spontaneous movements triggered optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. Dopamine self-stimulation rapidly and dynamically changes the structure of the entire behavioural repertoire. Initial stimulations reinforced not only the stimulation-producing target action, but also actions similar to the target action and actions that occurred a few seconds before stimulation. Repeated pairings led to a gradual refinement of the behavioural repertoire to home in on the target action. Reinforcement of action sequences revealed further temporal dependencies of refinement. Action pairs spontaneously separated by long time intervals promoted a stepwise credit assignment, with early refinement of actions most proximal to stimulation and subsequent refinement of more distal actions. Thus, a retrospective reinforcement mechanism promotes not only reinforcement, but also gradual refinement of the entire behavioural repertoire to assign credit to specific actions and action sequences that lead to dopamine release.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06941-5
Nature,2024-Feb,A molecular switch for neuroprotective astrocyte reactivity.,"The intrinsic mechanisms that regulate neurotoxic versus neuroprotective astrocyte phenotypes and their effects on central nervous system degeneration and repair remain poorly understood. Here we show that injured white matter astrocytes differentiate into two distinct C3-positive and C3-negative reactive populations, previously simplified as neurotoxic (A1) and neuroprotective (A2)<sup>1,2</sup>, which can be further subdivided into unique subpopulations defined by proliferation and differential gene expression signatures. We find the balance of neurotoxic versus neuroprotective astrocytes is regulated by discrete pools of compartmented cyclic adenosine monophosphate derived from soluble adenylyl cyclase and show that proliferating neuroprotective astrocytes inhibit microglial activation and downstream neurotoxic astrocyte differentiation to promote retinal ganglion cell survival. Finally, we report a new, therapeutically tractable viral vector to specifically target optic nerve head astrocytes and show that raising nuclear or depleting cytoplasmic cyclic AMP in reactive astrocytes inhibits deleterious microglial or macrophage cell activation and promotes retinal ganglion cell survival after optic nerve injury. Thus, soluble adenylyl cyclase and compartmented, nuclear- and cytoplasmic-localized cyclic adenosine monophosphate in reactive astrocytes act as a molecular switch for neuroprotective astrocyte reactivity that can be targeted to inhibit microglial activation and neurotoxic astrocyte differentiation to therapeutic effect. These data expand on and define new reactive astrocyte subtypes and represent a step towards the development of gliotherapeutics for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06935-3
Nature,2024-Feb,Prevention of respiratory virus transmission by resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.,"An ideal vaccine both attenuates virus growth and disease in infected individuals and reduces the spread of infections in the population, thereby generating herd immunity. Although this strategy has proved successful by generating humoral immunity to measles, yellow fever and polio, many respiratory viruses evolve to evade pre-existing antibodies<sup>1</sup>. One approach for improving the breadth of antiviral immunity against escape variants is through the generation of memory T cells in the respiratory tract, which are positioned to respond rapidly to respiratory virus infections<sup>2-6</sup>. However, it is unknown whether memory T cells alone can effectively surveil the respiratory tract to the extent that they eliminate or greatly reduce viral transmission following exposure of an individual to infection. Here we use a mouse model of natural parainfluenza virus transmission to quantify the extent to which memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells resident in the respiratory tract can provide herd immunity by reducing both the susceptibility of acquiring infection and the extent of transmission, even in the absence of virus-specific antibodies. We demonstrate that protection by resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells requires the antiviral cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) and leads to altered transcriptional programming of epithelial cells within the respiratory tract. These results suggest that tissue-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the respiratory tract can have important roles in protecting the host against viral disease and limiting viral spread throughout the population.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06937-1
Nature,2024-Feb,Cell-type-directed design of synthetic enhancers.,"Transcriptional enhancers act as docking stations for combinations of transcription factors and thereby regulate spatiotemporal activation of their target genes<sup>1</sup>. It has been a long-standing goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Here we show that deep learning models<sup>2-6</sup>, can be used to efficiently design synthetic, cell-type-specific enhancers, starting from random sequences, and that this optimization process allows detailed tracing of enhancer features at single-nucleotide resolution. We evaluate the function of fully synthetic enhancers to specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We further exploit enhancer design to create 'dual-code' enhancers that target two cell types and minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully functional. By examining the state space searches towards local optima, we characterize enhancer codes through the strength, combination and arrangement of transcription factor activator and transcription factor repressor motifs. Finally, we apply the same strategies to successfully design human enhancers, which adhere to enhancer rules similar to those of Drosophila enhancers. Enhancer design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to manipulate cell states.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06936-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Targeted design of synthetic enhancers for selected tissues in the Drosophila embryo.,"Enhancers control gene expression and have crucial roles in development and homeostasis<sup>1-3</sup>. However, the targeted de novo design of enhancers with tissue-specific activities has remained challenging. Here we combine deep learning and transfer learning to design tissue-specific enhancers for five tissues in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo: the central nervous system, epidermis, gut, muscle and brain. We first train convolutional neural networks using genome-wide single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) datasets and then fine-tune the convolutional neural networks with smaller-scale data from in vivo enhancer activity assays, yielding models with 13% to 76% positive predictive value according to cross-validation. We designed and experimentally assessed 40 synthetic enhancers (8 per tissue) in vivo, of which 31 (78%) were active and 27 (68%) functioned in the target tissue (100% for central nervous system and muscle). The strategy of combining genome-wide and small-scale functional datasets by transfer learning is generally applicable and should enable the design of tissue-, cell type- and cell state-specific enhancers in any system.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06905-9
Nature,2024-Feb,Transport and inhibition mechanisms of human VMAT2.,"Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) accumulates monoamines in presynaptic vesicles for storage and exocytotic release, and has a vital role in monoaminergic neurotransmission<sup>1-3</sup>. Dysfunction of monoaminergic systems causes many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, hyperkinetic movement disorders and depression<sup>4-6</sup>. Suppressing VMAT2 with reserpine and tetrabenazine alleviates symptoms of hypertension and Huntington's disease<sup>7,8</sup>, respectively. Here we describe cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VMAT2 complexed with serotonin and three clinical drugs at 3.5-2.8 Å, demonstrating the structural basis for transport and inhibition. Reserpine and ketanserin occupy the substrate-binding pocket and lock VMAT2 in cytoplasm-facing and lumen-facing states, respectively, whereas tetrabenazine binds in a VMAT2-specific pocket and traps VMAT2 in an occluded state. The structures in three distinct states also reveal the structural basis of the VMAT2 transport cycle. Our study establishes a structural foundation for the mechanistic understanding of substrate recognition, transport, drug inhibition and pharmacology of VMAT2 while shedding light on the rational design of potential therapeutic agents.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06926-4
Nature,2024-Feb,SlyB encapsulates outer membrane proteins in stress-induced lipid nanodomains.,"The outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria consists of an asymmetric phospholipid-lipopolysaccharide bilayer that is densely packed with outer-membrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs) and lipoproteins<sup>1</sup>. The architecture and composition of this bilayer is closely monitored and is essential to cell integrity and survival<sup>2-4</sup>. Here we find that SlyB, a lipoprotein in the PhoPQ stress regulon, forms stable stress-induced complexes with the outer-membrane proteome. SlyB comprises a 10 kDa periplasmic β-sandwich domain and a glycine zipper domain that forms a transmembrane α-helical hairpin with discrete phospholipid- and lipopolysaccharide-binding sites. After loss in lipid asymmetry, SlyB oligomerizes into ring-shaped transmembrane complexes that encapsulate β-barrel proteins into lipid nanodomains of variable size. We find that the formation of SlyB nanodomains is essential during lipopolysaccharide destabilization by antimicrobial peptides or acute cation shortage, conditions that result in a loss of OMPs and compromised outer-membrane barrier function in the absence of a functional SlyB. Our data reveal that SlyB is a compartmentalizing transmembrane guard protein that is involved in cell-envelope proteostasis and integrity, and suggest that SlyB represents a larger family of broadly conserved lipoproteins with 2TM glycine zipper domains with the ability to form lipid nanodomains.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06925-5
Nature,2024-Feb,Logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays.,"Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing<sup>1</sup>, requiring quantum error correction (QEC)<sup>2-6</sup> for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected 'logical' qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy<sup>2-4</sup>, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays<sup>7</sup>, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities<sup>8</sup>, arbitrary connectivity<sup>7,9</sup>, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout<sup>10-15</sup>. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code<sup>6</sup> distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities<sup>5</sup>, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D [[8,3,2]] code blocks<sup>16,17</sup>, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits<sup>18</sup> with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity<sup>19</sup> with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates<sup>20</sup>. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling<sup>21,22</sup>. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path towards large-scale logical processors.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06927-3
Nature,2024-Feb,Reverse metabolomics for the discovery of chemical structures from humans.,"Determining the structure and phenotypic context of molecules detected in untargeted metabolomics experiments remains challenging. Here we present reverse metabolomics as a discovery strategy, whereby tandem mass spectrometry spectra acquired from newly synthesized compounds are searched for in public metabolomics datasets to uncover phenotypic associations. To demonstrate the concept, we broadly synthesized and explored multiple classes of metabolites in humans, including N-acyl amides, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, bile acid esters and conjugated bile acids. Using repository-scale analysis<sup>1,2</sup>, we discovered that some conjugated bile acids are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Validation using four distinct human IBD cohorts showed that cholic acids conjugated to Glu, Ile/Leu, Phe, Thr, Trp or Tyr are increased in Crohn's disease. Several of these compounds and related structures affected pathways associated with IBD, such as interferon-γ production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>3</sup> and agonism of the pregnane X receptor<sup>4</sup>. Culture of bacteria belonging to the Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Enterococcus genera produced these bile amidates. Because searching repositories with tandem mass spectrometry spectra has only recently become possible, this reverse metabolomics approach can now be used as a general strategy to discover other molecules from human and animal ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06906-8
Nature,2024-Feb,Hypoblast from human pluripotent stem cells regulates epiblast development.,"Recently, several studies using cultures of human embryos together with single-cell RNA-seq analyses have revealed differences between humans and mice, necessitating the study of human embryos<sup>1-8</sup>. Despite the importance of human embryology, ethical and legal restrictions have limited post-implantation-stage studies. Thus, recent efforts have focused on developing in vitro self-organizing models using human stem cells<sup>9-17</sup>. Here, we report genetic and non-genetic approaches to generate authentic hypoblast cells (naive hPSC-derived hypoblast-like cells (nHyCs))-known to give rise to one of the two extraembryonic tissues essential for embryonic development-from naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Our nHyCs spontaneously assemble with naive hPSCs to form a three-dimensional bilaminar structure (bilaminoids) with a pro-amniotic-like cavity. In the presence of additional naive hPSC-derived analogues of the second extraembryonic tissue, the trophectoderm, the efficiency of bilaminoid formation increases from 20% to 40%, and the epiblast within the bilaminoids continues to develop in response to trophectoderm-secreted IL-6. Furthermore, we show that bilaminoids robustly recapitulate the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis and the formation of cells reflecting the pregastrula stage, the emergence of which can be shaped by genetically manipulating the DKK1/OTX2 hypoblast-like domain. We have therefore successfully modelled and identified the mechanisms by which the two extraembryonic tissues efficiently guide the stage-specific growth and progression of the epiblast as it establishes the post-implantation landmarks of human embryogenesis.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06871-2
Nature,2024-Feb,Heavy-element production in a compact object merger observed by JWST.,"The mergers of binary compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes are of central interest to several areas of astrophysics, including as the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)<sup>1</sup>, sources of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs)<sup>2</sup> and likely production sites for heavy-element nucleosynthesis by means of rapid neutron capture (the r-process)<sup>3</sup>. Here we present observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 230307A. We show that GRB 230307A belongs to the class of long-duration GRBs associated with compact object mergers<sup>4-6</sup> and contains a kilonova similar to AT2017gfo, associated with the GW merger GW170817 (refs. <sup>7-12</sup>). We obtained James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy 29 and 61 days after the burst. The spectroscopy shows an emission line at 2.15 microns, which we interpret as tellurium (atomic mass A = 130) and a very red source, emitting most of its light in the mid-infrared owing to the production of lanthanides. These observations demonstrate that nucleosynthesis in GRBs can create r-process elements across a broad atomic mass range and play a central role in heavy-element nucleosynthesis across the Universe.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06759-1
